And while the excesses of the 1990s tech boom-and-bust are still fresh in many investors\\' memories, today\\'s tech stars, by and large, produce significant revenue and profits, in contrast with the many pretenders of that prior period.\\nWhile several outperformers are large, well-known consumer brands, some lesser-known tech names have also established leading positions amid massive paradigm shifts. Here are two market-beating tech stocks to consider, and the megatrends they\\'re riding.\\n1. Micron\\nMegatrend: Computing everywhere.\\nTrailing 12-month returns: 128%\\nMicron (NASDAQ: MU) is a leading producer of several types of memory, the \"nuts and bolts\" in virtually every type of storage and/or computer processing device.\\nThe two main types of computing memory are NAND flash and DRAM. NAND flash stores memory \"at rest,\" and retains data even when power is turned off. DRAM is much faster than NAND, but works only with continuous power.\\nHistorically, memory has been a violently cyclical, commodity-like business, with wild pricing swings based on supply and end demand. However, like the airline industry, the memory industry has consolidated over the past decade, and the complexity of making ever-denser chips has changed the dynamic.\\nMicron is currently one of only three major DRAM producers, and one of five major NAND producers, with about two-thirds of its business in the more consolidated DRAM market.\\nAnd on the demand side, the need for computing power is exploding beyond traditional smartphones and laptops, to cloud-computing data centers, tech-heavy industrial equipment for the Internet of Things , and self-driving cars . It\\'s also worth noting that these demands feed on one another. For instance, as cars collect and process more data on the road, that data is also likely shared with a cloud data center.\\nTight supply and skyrocketing demand helped Micron\\'s revenue to soar a whopping 71.4% last quarter, and it\\'s no surprise the stock has followed suit.\\n2. Arista Networks\\nMegatrends: Software-defined networking; cloud computing.\\nTrailing 12-month returns: 130%\\nArista Networks \\' (NYSE: ANET) meteoric rise in 2017 can be attributed to its leading position in software-defined networking for data center switches, products which have been in high demand due to the rise of cloud computing .\\nAcross all sorts of industries and enterprises, IT teams are increasingly choosing to shift their data and applications from a private data center and into large public clouds. IT research firm Gartner (NYSE: IT) estimates the cloud computing market will total roughly $260 billion in 2017, good for 18.5% growth over 2016.\\nPublic data centers require massive amounts of networking equipment in the form of switches, which have traditionally been expensive. However, recent technological advances have moved much of the functionality in switches to software, rather than the more interconnected hardware-and-software combinations of the past.\\nArista Networks jumped on the trend early, investing over 1,000 man-years of work on 10 million lines of code in its EOS operating system. The emphasis on the operating system software allows Arista to make switches out of \"merchant\" hardware components from other low-cost vendors, which enables it to produce high-performing switches for significantly lower costs than traditional vendors such as Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) .\\nAs large cloud players build out their data centers at massive scale, price-performance characteristics are paramount. And it\\'s no surprise that Arista\\'s stock has rocketed as a result.\\nWhile the past year has been very kind to these two companies, the megatrends they\\'re riding aren\\'t slowing down anytime soon. Growth investors should take note.\\n10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology\\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.*\\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Micron Technology wasn\\'t one of them! That\\'s right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\\nClick here to learn about these picks!\\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 5, 2018\\nBilly Duberstein owns shares of Micron Technology.

We are not out of the woods as inflation remains elevated. In the post-FOMC meeting statement in November, the Fed Chairman clearly indicated that the terminal interest rate in this rate-hiking cycle will be higher than 5%.\\nYet, markets continue to rally on the assumption that the Fed may lower the magnitude of rate hike from the December FOMC meeting. A series of recently released economic data has also suggested that the central bank’s ultra-hawkish monetary policies started giving the needed results albeit a slow pace.\\nOn the other hand, the technology sector has been suffering a bloody blow in 2022 after witnessing a meteoric rise in the last two coronavirus-ridden years. Shares of several technology behemoths have plummeted due to a higher interest rate regime, the soaring yield on U.S. government bonds and a higher valuation of the sector.\\nThe Wall Street rally is likely to continue in the near term as the last two months of any year generally remain favorable for investors. Moreover, the midterm election of the U.S. Congress is scheduled on Nov 8. A split Congress may escalate the ongoing rally.\\nAt this stage, it should be prudent to invest in beaten-down technology stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are likely to gain for the rest of 2022. Here are five such stocks —  Airbnb Inc. ABNB, Fortinet Inc. FTNT, Datadog Inc. DDOG, Paycom Software Inc. PAYC and Zscaler Inc. ZS.\\nTech is a Long-Term Bullish Sector — Buy on the Dip\\nA series of breakthroughs in 5G wireless network, cloud computing, predictive analysis, AI, self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and IoT, has given a boost to the overall technology space. Consequently, the sector has vast potential.\\nThe leading emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, Africa and some European countries are still way behind in using digital technology compared to the developed world. While mobile phone penetration is nearly 90% in these countries, a large number of people are still using phones with old features, since voice communication instead of data has served most of their needs. Even those using smartphones, rarely utilize online digital features.   \\nHowever, the outbreak of coronavirus quickly changed the lifestyle and lookout of these people. They were not entirely used to the digital platforms for their office work (work from home), ordering food and other daily needs or transferring money and making payments. Moreover, online schooling, video conferencing and virtual networking have now become essential.\\nCountries that are more digitized were able to minimize their losses during the pandemic. These are major lessons for the other countries. Even those less inclined toward digital technology and online platforms, either because they have to learn using smartphones or tablets or due to fear of data theft, are now realizing the huge advantage of the online platforms.\\nOur Top Picks\\nWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. technology stocks currently trading at a deep discount to their 52-week highs. These stocks have strong potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\nAirbnb is riding on an improvement in the travel industry. Continued recovery in both longer-distance and cross-border travel owing to a reduction in travel restrictions is benefiting ABNB’s Nights & Experience bookings. Additionally, growth in Average Daily Rates and Gross Booking Value is acting as a tailwind.\\nGrowing active listings in Latin America, North America and EMEA are contributing well to the top line. Growing sales and marketing initiatives along with continuous efforts to upgrade various aspects of the Airbnb service are helping the company gain momentum among hosts and guests.\\nAirbnb has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 4.9% over the last seven days. ABNB is currently trading at a 55.1% discount to its 52-week high.\\nFortinet is benefiting from rising demand for security and networking products amid the coronavirus crisis as a huge global workforce is working remotely. FTNT is also benefiting from robust growth in Fortinet Security Fabric, cloud and Software-defined Wide Area Network offerings.\\nMoreover, continued deal wins, especially those of high value, are solid drivers. Higher IT spending on cybersecurity is expected to aid Fortinet grow faster than the security market. Also, focus on enhancing its unified threat management portfolio through product development and acquisitions is a tailwind for FTNT.\\nFortinet has an expected earnings growth rate of 33.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 1.9% over the last seven days. FTNT is currently trading at a 35.6% discount to its 52-week high.\\nZscaler is benefiting from the rising demand for cyber-security solutions owing to the slew of data breaches. Increasing demand for privileged access security on digital transformation and cloud-migration strategies is a key growth driver of ZS.\\nZscaler’s portfolio boosts its competitive edge and helps add users. Moreover, a strong presence across verticals, such as banking, insurance, healthcare, public sector, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications services and education, is safeguarding Zscaler from the pandemic’s negative impact. Also, recent acquisitions, like Smokescreen and Trustdome, are expected to enhance ZS’ portfolio.\\nZscaler has an expected earnings growth rate of 71% for the current year (for July 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 14.6% over the last 30 days. ZS is currently trading at a 68.8% discount to its 52-week high.\\nDatadog is benefitting from new customer additions and increased adoption of its cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform driven by accelerated digital transformation and cloud migration across organizations.\\nSolid adoption of Synthetics and Network Performance Monitoring products are expected to aid customer wins for DDOG in the near term. Contributions from a solid cloud partner base, including Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, remain the key growth driver for DDOG besides an expanding portfolio.\\n\\nDatadog has an expected earnings growth rate of 64.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 1.3% over the last seven days. DDOG is currently trading at a 65.2% discount to its 52-week high.\\nPaycom is a provider of cloud-based human capital management software as a service solution for integrated software for both employee records and talent management processes.\\nPAYC’s differentiated employee strategy, measurement capabilities and comprehensive product offerings are helping it win new customers. Further, solutions like Ask Here and Manager on-the-Go, both focusing on employee usage and efficiency, are tailwinds.\\nPaycom has an expected earnings growth rate of 30.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.9% over the last seven days. PAYC is currently trading at a 42.7% discount to its 52-week high.\\n\\nZacks Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\\nIt’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.\\nThis company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.\\nFree: See Our Top Stock and 4 Runners Up >>\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Several common trends can be identified across the provided articles, all of which focus on the technology sector and its fluctuations in relation to broader economic factors. Here are the key themes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Market Volatility and Mixed Performance**: Articles reflect a consistent pattern of volatility in the stock market, particularly within technology stocks. In some instances, like in the first article, major tech firms like Amazon and Intel performed strongly amidst mixed global market trends, indicating that while certain tech stocks can thrive, overall market performance remains varied.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Impact of Inflation and Interest Rates**: The articles frequently mention ongoing concerns regarding high inflation and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. The first article highlights that although inflation remains high, it's expected to cool, leading to speculation about the Fed halting interest rate hikes. This sentiment is echoed in the third article, which suggests that although inflation is still a concern, reduced rate hike magnitude could benefit markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Technological Advancements and Megatrends**: Several articles discuss ongoing technological advancements and the megatrends driving the tech sector, such as cloud computing, cybersecurity, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Articles like the second and third ones emphasize how companies like Micron and Arista Networks are positioned well due to their involvement in emerging technologies, reinforcing the belief that despite current headwinds, the tech sector's growth potential remains strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sector-Specific Challenges**: The trend of segment-specific challenges is evident, especially within the semiconductor industry. Articles illustrate how chipmakers face significant pressures, with some stocks facing sharp declines. This sector, vital for many tech developments, appears critically sensitive to broader economic conditions, including supply and demand dynamics, and overall market sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Gradual Recovery Speculation**: Overall, there's a focus on potential recovery and optimism, especially in the context of favorable market conditions historically observed during the year's concluding months or due to upcoming political events (like midterm elections mentioned in the third article). This optimism suggests that investors remain hopeful about a rebound, despite current challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Investment Opportunities**: Several articles present investment strategies focusing on \"buying the dip\" in undervalued tech stocks, highlighting a belief among analysts that certain companies in the tech sector could present strong future returns as technological needs evolve and markets stabilize.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while the technology sector faces short-term challenges influenced by macroeconomic factors, there is an underlying belief in its long-term growth potential driven by innovation and digital transformation trends. Investors are urged to look for opportunities amidst volatility, particularly in companies well-positioned to leverage these megatrends.\n",
