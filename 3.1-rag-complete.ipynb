(NYSE: DT) is holding gains since its February 1 earnings report and managed to eke out a gain of 0.54% the week ended February 24, defying the broad market pullback.\\nMassachusetts-based Dynatrace uses AI to deliver application and digital infrastructure monitoring, as well as security services, for its enterprise customers. Its premise is to allow users to “do more with less.” \\nIt leverages AI and other intelligent automation to help customers streamline their cloud operations and automate DevSecOps. That process allows companies to introduce software security early in the development cycle.\\nThe company has partnered with several cloud and app developers, so its customers can integrate Dynatrace’s software with systems they are already using. Cloud and tech partners include Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM), Oracle Corp. (NYSE: ORCL), VMWare Inc. (NYSE: VMW), and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE), among many others. \\nDouble-Digit Growth\\nDynatrace gapped up 15.90% on February 1, following a better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter report.  The company reported earnings of $0.25 a share on revenue of $297.46 million, topping Wall Street views. Those marked year-over-year growth rates of 39% and 24%, respectively. \\nThat level of increase tends to be a hallmark of growth stocks, especially when a company has a history of strong double-digit quarterly increases, as is the case with Dynatrace. \\nAnalysts had forecast net income of $0.21 a share on sales of $285 million. \\nFor the current quarter, which wraps up in March, the company issued revenue guidance in a range between $304 million and $307 million. This was well above the $292 million midpoint of analysts’ estimates. \\nThese gains come when Wall Street is fretting about tech revenue and earnings. Companies can turn to tech spending to cut costs in a high inflation and high interest-rate environment. This is one of the reasons why many analysts expect tech earnings to slow this year. \\nIn a January report issued by asset manager Allianz Bernstein, Voya portfolio managers Erik Swords and Brandon Michael wrote that it’s important for investors to keep an eye on IT spending levels, as they relate to tech earnings. \\nIT Projects Under Scrutiny\\n“Some estimates for corporate spending on IT show growth of nearly 5% in 2023. We think such numbers are unrealistic in the near term,” they said. “Amid economic uncertainty, discretionary IT projects are coming under greater scrutiny and being delayed or canceled as firms choose to focus on mission-critical IT assets. We expect this trend to continue through the first half of 2023 before a potentially improving outlook emerges in the latter part of the year.” \\nIn that context, Dynatrace’s forecast is that much more impressive. \\nOn February 16, rival Datadog Inc. (NASDAQ: DDOG) reported fourth-quarter results that topped views, but the company’s full-year guidance disappointed. The company expects revenue between $2.07 billion and $2.09 billion and adjusted earnings at $1.02 to $1.09 per share. Wall Street viewed those projections as conservative and would also indicate a deceleration of growth. \\nDynatrace's Competitive Advantage\\nFollowing Dynatrace’s earnings report, Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan wrote, “In our opinion, the firm’s strong execution of its land-and-expand strategy, as evidenced by its solid net retention metric, augments its competitive advantage by increasing switching costs.”\\nIn other words, the company will land a deal with a customer, then expand it with additional paid services. That’s a way of retaining customers and acquiring new business more efficiently than going after new customers for all additional revenue. It also helps lock in customers who don’t want the hassle of switching to another provider. \\nDynatrace shares may be in the process of forming a post-gap-up base. However, shares have been getting support along their 21-day moving average, which could also be a place to purchase or add new shares.\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\", 'stock_symbol': 'MSFT'}\n",

But even with those gains, the industry is still just scratching the surface of its potential.\\nA new report from McKinsey Digital, which looks at cost-optimization and business use-cases, says there is $1 trillion in run-rate EBITDA up for grabs for Fortune 500 companies in 2030. And the companies that most aggressively pursue cloud opportunities could grab the lion’s share of that value.\\nThe sector has seen its value soar in the past eight years. Since 2013, cloud companies on the Nasdaq index have seen their value increase 261%, according to the Bessemer Venture Partners Emerging Cloud Index, a stock index designed to track the performance of emerging public companies primarily involved in providing cloud software to their customers. Those companies currently have a market capitalization of $2 trillion.\\nCloud growth rates and access to capital are at all-time highs, says Bessemer, with an average growth of 80% YoY, among companies it follows. Over the past year, the top five public cloud companies — Paypal, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify and Zoom – saw a 70% increase in their total market cap. Collectively, the five are already worth more than $1 trillion.\\nAnd the bullishness on the future financial potential of cloud computing is widespread. IDC, last fall, estimated worldwide spending on cloud services, and opportunities around those services, would top $1 trillion by 2024.\\n\"Cloud in all its permutations – hardware/software/services/as a service as well as public/private/hybrid/multi/edge – will play ever greater, and even dominant, roles across the IT industry for the foreseeable future,\" said Richard L. Villars, group vice president of worldwide research at IDC. \"By the end of 2021, based on lessons learned in the pandemic, most enterprises will put a mechanism in place to accelerate their shift to cloud-centric digital infrastructure and application services twice as fast as before the pandemic.\"\\nCloud technology, for many people, brings to mind things like smartphone or PC backup tools, online services or streaming media – the most frequently touted use-cases. But it has some much more direct real-world uses – perhaps most importantly, its recent contributions to COVID-19 vaccines.\\nModerna built its mRNA research platform on Amazon’s cloud service to accelerate discovery and development – and when COVID hit, this helped the company deliver its first clinical batch of a vaccine candidate within 42 days of the sequencing of the virus. Scientists were able to integrate insights for a number of experiments, which were all running in parallel, to refine and streamline the production cycle.\\nAnd the cloud is also playing a key role in the company’s research into treatments for rare diseases and cancer. The company has over one dozen drug candidates in the pipeline, with seven going through trial studies.\\n“For CEOs, cloud adoption is not just an engine for revenue growth and efficiency,” McKinsey notes. “Its speed, scale, innovation, and productivity benefits are essential to the pursuit of broader digital business opportunities, now and well into the future. Yet an overly narrow view of cloud-value economics and where value exists often keeps companies from achieving the desired outcomes.”\\nThe potential financial gains in cloud technology are universal, says McKinsey, but some industries are better positioned than others. High tech, oil and gas, retail, healthcare systems and services, insurance, and banking are best positioned to generate value, with EBITDA impacts of up to $160 billion per company.\\nIn each of those fields, the cloud can unlock value via technology use cases, ranging from inventory optimization at retailers to automated supply-and-demand forecasting for oil and gas companies to customer call optimization for banks, directing distressed customers to more experienced representatives.\\nAchieving those gains will take more than simply transferring an operation or two to the cloud, though. Companies will need to learn how to utilize the technology’s full value and build their milestones around a life cycle, which will accelerate product development.\\n“Organizations that simply ‘lift and shift’ applications to cloud with no change to architecture miss out on key benefits, such as autoscaling and automated performance management,” the McKinsey report said.\\nThe pandemic, of course, has been a big accelerant for cloud adoption. As companies have shifted to a telecommuting norm, they’ve increasingly relied on cloud services to help them run parts of their businesses. And stepping back from that is unlikely.\\n“Cloud’s acceleration is permanent and COVID-19 more than doubled the rate of digital transformation across different vertical industries, impacting people’s everyday lives,” said Bessemer. “Within the next three years, we expect the cloud will become the dominant delivery model for all software, as we embody a cloud-first world.”\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.', 'stock_symbol': 'ADBE'}\n",

On an average, Oracle has delivered positive earnings surprise of 1.44% in the last four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.\\nGrowth Factors in the Past Quarter\\nOracle reported disappointing third-quarter 2014, as both earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, management provided optimistic guidance for the fourth quarter, with earnings forecasted to be in the range of 92 to 99 cents per share much better than 87 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.\\nRevenues on a non-GAAP basis are expected to grow in the range of 3.0% to 7.0% (in dollar). Cloud subscription and new software license revenues (expected to range within 0.0% to 10.0%) are expected to be the key growth factors in the quarter. Growth in hardware (expected in the range of 0.0% to 10.0%) will be keenly watched by investors.\\nOracle's strong and innovative product portfolio and encouraging growth prospects in cloud and Big Data are the key positives. Moreover, higher subscription revenues are expected to provide a recurring high-margin revenue base. Nevertheless, competition from the likes of IBM, Workday and SAP AG ( SAP ) remains a concern.\\nEarnings Whispers\\nOur proven model does not conclusively show that Oracle is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.\\nZacks ESP : Oracle currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 92 cents.\\nZacks Rank : Oracle has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.\\nWe caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.\\nOther Stocks to Consider\\nHere are a couple of stocks worth considering that, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:\\nMicron Technology ( MU ) , Earnings ESP of +5.80% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\\nFactSet Research ( FDS ) , Earnings ESP of +2.38% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Helping spark the AI gold rush in 2023 are recent developments in the field of generative AI, which can create original output, handle repetitive tasks, conduct research, and even write code.\\nBusiness executives are scrambling to implement this technology, which promises vast productivity gains, saving companies time and money.\\nThis week yielded several important examples of how big tech plans to capitalize on this technology.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nAlexa gets an upgrade\\nIn conjunction with Amazon\\'s (NASDAQ: AMZN) 2023 hardware reveal and the release of new Echo devices, the company announced a generative AI upgrade for Alexa, its voice-controlled digital assistant. In a blog post on its site, Amazon said it\\'s \"an even smarter, and more conversational Alexa ... that\\'s been custom-built and specifically optimized for voice interactions\" while keeping existing functionality like \"getting real-time information, efficient smart home control, and maximizing [users] home entertainment.\"\\nCustomers will soon get a preview of Alexa\\'s new generative AI capabilities by saying, \"Alexa, let\\'s chat\" using any new or existing Echo smart devices. Amazon revealed that more than \"half a billion\" Echo devices have been sold, racking up \"tens of millions of interactions every hour.\"\\nIn addition to making Alexa more conversational and less robotic, Amazon fused input from the Echo device sensors to AI models \"that can understand non-verbal cues\" such as body language, eye contact, and knowledge of the speaker. The company is also working to reduce latency to reduce Alexa\\'s pause time.\\nAs groundbreaking as it was when Alexa was first released, the novelty has worn off for some users. If Amazon can breathe new life into Alexa, it might also increase demand for its electronic devices and boost sales on its e-commerce site.\\nGoogle\\'s AI goes further afield\\nIt\\'s been several months since Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) launched Google\\'s generative AI, dubbed Bard. Now, Bard can be used alongside a host of Google products and services.\\nIn a blog post on the company\\'s website, Google announced that it was rolling out Bard Extensions, which integrate with a user\\'s existing Google tools, including Gmail, Docs, Drive, Google Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and Hotels. The system has the ability to draw inputs from multiple apps and services simultaneously, which helps Bard surface more relevant content for the user.\\nOne of the more useful upgrades will allow Bard to double-check the answers it gives. Users can use Bard\\'s \"Google it\" button to evaluate and substantiate the content it creates. Bard will also notify the user when it detects contradictory information so it can be verified.\\nGoogle said these upgrades come courtesy of the company\\'s latest large language model, Pathways Language Model, PaLM2. The company also noted that it \"applied state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques to train the model to be more intuitive and imaginative.\"\\nBy integrating Bard functionality that works directly with Google\\'s existing products -- many of which have more than a billion users each -- Alphabet is making those products even stickier, meaning consumers are more likely to continue using them.\\nNvidia scouts its next strategic stronghold\\nFresh on the heels of a whirlwind tour earlier this month, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang touted the benefits of expanding the company\\'s relationship with India. With a population of 1.4 billion -- which recently surpassed China -- Huang believes India can potentially be \"one of the largest AI markets in the world.\"\\nNvidia\\'s graphics processing units (GPUs) have been a key component in developing next-generation AI systems. Recent trade sanctions restrict Nvidia from exporting its most advanced chips to China, as the government fears the technology could be reverse-engineered and deployed in military or cyberwarfare applications.\\nThat makes India an important perspective market for Nvidia, and the company doesn\\'t plan to sit idly by. In a news conference in Bangalore, the chief executive said of the country, \"You have the data, you have the talent,\" adding, \"This is going to be one of the largest AI markets in the world.\" India is currently working to build out its AI infrastructure, and India\\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi cited \"the rich potential India offers in the world of AI.\"\\nIt\\'s worth noting that Nvidia already has four engineering centers and roughly 4,000 engineers in the country -- second only to its workforce in the United States. It will probably be several years before his plans come to fruition. But if and when they do, Huang is working to set the stage for Nvidia\\'s next big production hub and AI chip market.\\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon.com\\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "{'url': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-under-the-radar-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-ready-to-pop', 'article_title': '3 Under-the-Radar Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Ready to Pop', 'date': datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 27, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), 'stock_symbol': 'ADBE', 'article': \"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot area to invest in the stock market now for a good reason: The limits of AI are seemingly boundless. However, all that hype can lead to many stocks becoming overvalued, leading to disappointments when they crash back down to reality. These bubbles occurred throughout stock market history and are nothing new.\\nBut plenty of AI stocks still haven't seen the hype and are ready to explode higher. So, if you're looking for a few under-the-radar AI stocks to buy, here's a great starter list.\\nAI is a bonus for each of these companies\\nThe three stocks I think have the potential to pop are UiPath (NYSE: PATH), Upstart (NASDAQ: UPST), and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE). All of them are highly exposed to the AI trend and have reasonable valuations, priming them to see a quick uptick with large enough investor interest.\\nUiPath is a robotic process automation (RPA) leader, which isn't an AI technology in itself. RPA records repetitive tasks and then automates them, freeing employees to do more complex and creative tasks. It also integrates nicely with AI, as AI widens the scope of processes it can automate. Additionally, UiPath can utilize artificial intelligence to monitor activity to pinpoint tasks that could be automated.\\nUpstart is an alternative to the FICO credit score model operated by Fair Isaac. Instead of using a handful of metrics to judge a borrower's creditworthiness, it uses other factors like employment history, education level, and other in-depth metrics that provide lenders with a much better picture of the risk it is taking on. Upstart's use of AI in evaluating borrowers sets it apart in its industry, and many personal and auto loan banks have deployed its product.\\nAdobe is better known than the other two, but its AI prowess isn't. Adobe's Firefly AI is a true game-changer, as its users can type a prompt into Firefly, and then it can convert the command into modifying an image. This has massive implications, as advertisers could effortlessly tailor their marketing image to different audiences.\\nNone of these uses of AI are impractical, and each company is at the tipping point of artificial intelligence making a drastic business impact. But their stocks aren't caught up in the AI investment hype.\\nThe stocks don't trade at sky-high valuations\\nAdobe is the only profitable company of this trio, and its stock can be purchased for 32 times forward earnings. While that's not necessarily cheap, Adobe's stock never is. Since its change to a subscription business model stabilized in 2016, Adobe's stock has traded for about 50 times trailing earnings, on average.\\nADBE P/E Ratio data by YCharts.\\nGranted, Adobe's growth rate during that time frame was about 20% versus the latest quarter's 10% growth rate. But if Firefly AI takes off, don't be surprised to see Adobe's growth return to these rapid levels.\\nUiPath and Upstart are both unprofitable, so we'll use their price-to-sales (P/S) ratio to value them. Because both stocks were on the public market in 2021, they've already experienced a bubble.\\nUPST P/S Ratio data by YCharts.\\nHowever, each stock is now valued at a reasonable level, with Upstart trading at a much lower valuation than UiPath. That's because it isn't necessarily an AI story; it's also an interest-rate story. Due to high interest rates, the loan demand is less than just one year ago. As a result, Upstart's loan volumes tumbled, with Upstart only originating 109,000 loans in the second quarter versus 321,000 in last year's Q2. When interest rates decrease, it will be a huge catalyst for Upstart, and the growth and profitability it enjoyed last year should return.\\nUiPath is just waiting to be noticed, although some already have. Cathie Wood and her team at Ark Invest have made UiPath their third-largest holding, with 6.1% of the resources tied up in the stock. With the global RPA market opportunity expected to expand from $2.6 billion in 2022 to $66 billion by 2032, according to Polaris Market Research, UiPath is positioned to post explosive growth over the next decade. Combine that with the catalyst of artificial intelligence, and UiPath looks like an incredible investment opportunity.\\n10 stocks we like better than UiPath\\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company has been a pioneer in everything from e-commerce to e-books to cloud computing. However, the tech giant has been somewhat left out of market discussions around artificial intelligence (AI) thus far.\\nInstead, most of the market\\'s focus has been on its big tech peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), whose partner OpenAI kicked off the surge in interest in generative with its launch of ChatGPT, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), which has launched its own competitor to ChatGPT, Bard, and is making other moves in AI. Even Meta Platforms seems to be further along with its own large language model, LLaMa, than Amazon.\\nBut that doesn\\'t mean Amazon hasn\\'t been advancing its own AI-related efforts. And this month, Amazon made an attention-grabbing announcement that might put it back into the center of the AI discussion.\\nAmazon leaned on AI heavily in its fall device update last week when it rolled out new Alexa features, using AI to improve functionality and communication. This week, it announced a $1.25 billion immediate investment (with a commitment for up to $4 billion) in Anthropic, an AI start-up that makes its own AI chatbot, Claude.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nThe big news\\nIn a partnership similar to Microsoft\\'s arrangement with OpenAI, Amazon announced it was forming a \"strategic collaboration\" with Anthropic, a company founded by former members of OpenAI. The start-up will use Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider and Amazon\\'s Trainium and Inferentia chips to build its future large language models, giving Amazon a leg up in the semiconductor business, where it\\'s trying to stake a claim.\\nAnthropic will also make a long-term commitment to offering AWS customers access to future generations of its large language models through Amazon Bedrock, its cloud service dedicated to large language models. Amazon\\'s engineers will also be able to use Anthropic\\'s generative AI in their own work, building new Amazon applications.\\nIn exchange, Amazon will invest $1.25 billion in Anthropic, with the option of increasing that to $4 billion, getting it a minority stake in the company. While it\\'s unclear how much Anthropic is valued at now based on the arrangement, it appears to be significantly higher than the $5 billion it was valued at in early May prior to a $450 million funding round, which included tech heavyweights like Google, Salesforce, and Zoom Video Communications.\\nThe tie-up is similar to Amazon\\'s deal with Rivian when the tech giant initially invested $700 million in the EV maker in 2019 and the following year agreed to purchase 100,000 delivery vans from the company, giving Rivian a major source of demand and Amazon\\'s stamp of approval for its vehicles. Amazon now owns close to 20% of Rivian.\\nWhy it won\\'t help AI investors\\nIt\\'s now becoming clear who the early winners in the AI boom are, and with the exception of Nvidia, they aren\\'t the big tech companies that have been realigning themselves around AI.\\nInstead, they are the AI start-ups like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral AI, which raised a whopping $113 million in its seed round, valuing it at $260 million just weeks after its founding, without a product or barely any employees.\\nBig tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and others have billions of dollars to spend on AI tech and invest in the area, and they seem more than willing to continue to do so, which will pump up their valuations even more.\\nUnfortunately, ordinary investors have no easy way to invest in these privately held start-ups, and the more they raise on the private markets, the longer it will take to go public.\\nAmazon\\'s investment in Anthropic is another endorsement of the transformative potential of generative AI. However, the deal is unlikely to move the needle for Amazon anytime soon, meaning the Anthropic partnership shouldn\\'t drive your investment decision in Amazon.\\nFor now, most of the best opportunities in AI seem to be off-limits to retail investors.\\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon.com\\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It will also expose many AI-related investments propped up on a lot of hype. Those are stocks to avoid.\\nHowever, one stock that I'm confident will have a strong 2024 (and perhaps the best of all companies) is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). It is just starting to hit its stride in the AI space, and its primary business is also starting to turn around after a weak 2022 and 2023.\\nAlphabet has multiple strong products\\nAlphabet is the parent company of many well-known brands like Google, YouTube, and the Android operating system. While CEO Sundar Pichai has long declared Alphabet an AI-first company, its primary revenue stream is advertising.\\nIn the third quarter, 78% of revenue came from advertising. Advertising wasn't at its peak over the past few years, as many businesses were preparing for a recession and dialed back spending. But for the first time in several quarters, Alphabet's advertising wing had a solid quarter, growing revenue by 9%. This bodes well for 2024, as advertising still steers Alphabet.\\nIn addition to advertising is Alphabet's Google Cloud, its cloud computing wing. Cloud computing is also set up to have a strong 2024, as the computing capability combined with data storage that cloud computing provides will become critical as companies roll out their in-house AI solutions.\\nMentioning AI, Alphabet's Gemini was recently released and is the first model to surpass human experts in the massive multitask language understanding test, a popular way to measure an AI model's effectiveness. With its best-in-class performance (it beat OpenAI's GPT-4 model in many head-to-head competitions), Gemini should be a huge revenue boost for Alphabet as it's adopted.\\nHeading into 2024, Alphabet is well positioned to succeed. But just how much performance can Alphabet shareholders expect?\\nThe stock may be undervalued\\nAnother component in my prediction that Alphabet will have a great year is rooted in its current valuation. Over the past decade, Alphabet's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was about 30. This isn't out of line with what other big tech stocks trade at, as Apple and Microsoft each trade at around 30 times earnings or greater.\\nGOOGL PE Ratio data by YCharts\\nHowever, Alphabet doesn't have that same premium, as it only trades for 25.5 times earnings, which is about the same as the S&P 500's 24.6 times earnings. Essentially, the market values Alphabet like it's an average business, which is a huge mistake considering the potential upside.\\nIf you value Alphabet using 2024 earnings, it looks even cheaper at 20 times earnings.\\nIn 2024, if Alphabet delivers the earnings that analysts project and the stock reaches its average historical valuation of 30 times earnings, that would represent a 50% upside in the stock. But even if it remains at its current 25.5 times earnings valuation, Alphabet's stock will gain about 28% if it hits projections.\\nHowever, the tailwinds blowing in Alphabet's favor are just starting, and they will last beyond 2024. So, even though Alphabet is slated to have a strong 2024, I'm still excited to be a long-term shareholder.\\nWhile other AI stocks may have greater upside than Alphabet, few have the almost guaranteed positive return promise that Alphabet can provide shareholders in 2024. As a result, it's my top AI stock pick for 2024.\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

Incredible programs like ChatGPT have already passed the bar and U.S. medical licensing exam, but other, more practical uses of AI are already available for businesses to utilize.\\nTwo companies that utilize AI at the core of their software are CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR). Each stock has a huge runway, and investors should consider these two stocks to fill out the AI investment niche in their portfolio. Read on to find out why.\\n1. CrowdStrike\\nCrowdStrike utilizes AI to improve its cybersecurity software continuously. By analyzing trillions of signals weekly, CrowdStrike harnesses AI's power in a machine learning model to determine what activity is normal, an anomaly, or a threat. When one customer is attacked, it uses that information to improve the protection of all CrowdStrike clients, preventing an attacker from exploiting the same weakness twice.\\nThe solution is prevalent, with 21,146 clients as of Oct. 31, 2022, up 44% over last year's total. Among its customers are 40 U.S. state governments, 69 of the Fortune 500, and 15 of the top 20 U.S. banks. That's an impressive client list, but CrowdStrike's future growth depends on those customers expanding their usage.\\nCrowdStrike has over 20 modules that expand the base offering and empower security teams to both improve the platform and gain greater visibility into the threats a client faces. The more modules the average customer uses, the more revenue CrowdStrike brings in, and it has been quite successful in upselling its product to its customers.\\nNUMBER OF MODULES UTILIZED PERCENT OF CUSTOMER BASE YOY INCREASE\\n5 or More 60% 55%\\n6 or More 36% 66%\\n7 or More 21% 81%\\nSource: CrowdStrike.\\nNew customers and existing client expansion helped increase CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue by 54% to $2.34 billion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 (ended Oct. 31). It's also a free cash flow (FCF)-generating machine, converting 30% of Q3 revenue into FCF of $174 million.\\nFor the growth CrowdStrike is generating, its current price tag of 43 times FCF is a bargain -- that's only a 35% premium to Microsoft despite growing at a much faster pace. CrowdStrike is just in the early innings of its product deployment and is one of the best ways to invest in AI.\\n2. Palantir\\nPalantir utilizes AI in its software to crunch data and provide actionable insights. At first, its technology was developed for government use and reportedly helped the U.S. government pinpoint the final hideout of Osama bin Laden. Now, Palantir is rolling out its software for civilian use and is on a mission to help streamline a company's operations.\\nAs a testament to Palantir's usefulness, Tyson Foods realized about $200 million in cost savings across 20 different projects, and Swiss Re claimed Palantir's first $100 million or greater savings. As for new customers, Cloudflare recently signed a strategic partnership with Palantir to improve the costs associated with Cloudflare's cloud infrastructure offering.\\nWith only 228 commercial customers as of Sept. 30, investors might wonder why so few companies are using it. The answer lies in the cost -- a one-month subscription on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) store is $1 million per month. Because of its price tag, Palantir limits which customers can feasibly use its product to only the largest companies. However, that's still a sizable client base.\\nIt's also growing rapidly, with revenue up 22% year over year to $478 million. But U.S. commercial revenue (a key business focus) was up 53% in Q3. Unlike CrowdStrike, Palantir has a ways to go in its profitability department. FCF was $32.6 million for Q3 -- a 6.8% margin.\\nActual profits are even further off, with Palantir losing $124 million -- a 26% profit loss margin. Much of this loss is due to a high stock-based compensation bill of $140 million, although this was drastically down from 2021's Q3 value of $185 million. If investors take a position in Palantir, they will need to watch this trend to ensure it continues moving in the right direction, as Palantir has a lot of work to do before breaking even.\\nWith Palantir's current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, it's pretty clear the market is skeptical about any profits.\\nPLTR PS Ratio data by YCharts.\\nAt its current valuation, Palantir is worth taking a shot at, especially considering its powerful AI software. However, you'll have to be patient because it may take a while for profits to come to fruition.\\nFind out why CrowdStrike is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\\nOur award-winning analyst team has spent more than a decade beating the market.

All three major U.S. indexes plunged into a bear market and produced their worst single-year returns since 2008.\\nBut even amid a tumultuous environment for stocks, investors tend to find patches of inspiration. In 2023, that source of inspiration is anything that has to do with artificial intelligence (AI).\\nIn its simplest form, AI involves using machines or systems to handle tasks that humans would normally be responsible for. What makes AI so special is the ability for software and machines to grow smarter and evolve over time. This machine-learning capability is what gives AI such broad applications.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nIt also doesn't hurt that AI is expected to be one of the fastest sustainably growing opportunities this decade. A recent report from Grand View Research estimates the global AI market will grow by an annualized rate of 37.3% between 2023 and 2030 to reach a cool $1.81 trillion by the turn of the decade.\\nWith AI chatbot ChatGPT captivating the attention of innovation seekers and investors alike, the valuations of most AI stocks have soared in 2023. At the moment, there's one AI stock you can confidently pay a premium valuation for and not raise an eyebrow. Likewise, there's another pricey AI stock I'd suggest not touching with a 10-foot pole.\\nThe artificial intelligence stock worth paying a premium for: CrowdStrike Holdings\\nDespite what looks to be a U.S. recession on the horizon, you can confidently put your money to work in end-user cybersecurity stock CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD). Even with CrowdStrike valued at a nosebleed multiple of 57 times Wall Street's consensus forward-year earnings, it brings well-defined competitive advantages to the table.\\nBefore digging into company specifics, it's important to recognize that cybersecurity has evolved into a basic-necessity service over the past 20 years. No matter how poorly the U.S. economy and stock market perform, businesses of all sizes are going to continue to need cybersecurity solutions to protect their sensitive data. After all, hackers don't take time off just because Wall Street or the U.S. economy had a bad day.\\nCrowdStrike's biggest differentiating factor is Falcon, the company's cloud-native security platform. Falcon leans on AI and machine-learning to become more efficient over time at recognizing and responding to potential threats.\\nIn a typical week, the company notes, Falcon will oversee trillions of events. Each of those events adds to its collective intelligence and makes the platform that much more secure for its more than 21,100 subscribers.\\nThe testament to Falcon's efficacy can be seen in the company's steadily rising gross retention rate. It's no secret that CrowdStrike's software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions aren't the cheapest. Nevertheless, the company's gross retention rate has expanded from less than 94% to more than 98% in under six years. Subscribers are sticking with the company.\\nBut the top reason you can confidently pay a premium for shares of CrowdStrike is the willingness of the company's existing subscribers to add on to their original purchase. Roughly six years ago, a single-digit percentage of CrowdStrike 450 customers had purchased four or more of its cloud-module subscriptions. As of its latest quarterly filing, 60% of its 21,146 customers had purchased at least five cloud-module subscriptions. Add-on sales have lifted CrowdStrike's adjusted subscription gross margin to between 78% and 79% over the past three fiscal years (78% through the first nine months of fiscal 2023).\\nWith an adjusted subscription gross margin of nearly 80%, CrowdStrike's earnings growth has the ability to outpace revenue growth for the foreseeable future. That should help take the sting off of its lofty forward-year price-to-earnings ratio.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nThe pricey artificial intelligence stock to avoid like the plague: Nvidia\\nOn the other end of the spectrum is an ultra-popular AI stock with a premium valuation that you'd be wise to avoid like the plague. I'm talking about semiconductor solutions company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which is going for 50 times Wall Street's forecast earnings in fiscal 2024.\\nNvidia is best known for its role in the graphics processing unit (GPU) space. It's responsible for selling close to 20% of global GPUs, and has a veritable stranglehold on the discrete graphics card market, with an 80% share.\\nNvidia's GPUs are used by gamers, businesses operating data centers, and cryptocurrency miners. They're also expected to play a key role in the development of a variety of AI products.\\nIn one respect, this means Nvidia will be a key hardware player. Its GPUs will be leaned on for accelerated computing capabilities, which are vital for machine-learning/AI solutions.\\nIt also means Nvidia can become an AI player on its own merit -- i.e., beyond just supplying the necessary hardware. Over the past two years, Nvidia brought a number of AI initiatives to market, including its own virtual digital assistant solutions capable of helping businesses serve their customers by responding to voice commands.\\nWhile Nvidia does have a long-term pathway to success in AI, there are a couple of red flags that should keep it off investors' radars for perhaps the next year or few years. For instance, it's going to be awhile before AI is anything more than a marginal revenue driver for Nvidia.\\nAnother reason to be skeptical of Nvidia at a premium valuation is its gaming division. Gaming is incredibly important to Nvidia's profitability. Yet during the fiscal third quarter (note: this write-up is being done prior to Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings release on Feb. 22), Nvidia noted an unsightly 51% decline in year-over-year gaming revenue. As the COVID-19 pandemic gets placed into the rearview mirror and life returns to some semblance of normal, Nvidia's top segment could struggle to regain its luster, with people no longer stuck in their homes.\\nNvidia also tends to ebb and flow with the cryptocurrency industry. Since its GPUs are important to mining certain types of tokens, an extended bear market for crypto often removes a high-growth sales channel for Nvidia.\\nWith absolutely no sales growth expected in fiscal 2023 and practically all semiconductor stocks warning about weakening demand/orders for the current calendar year, Nvidia at 50 times forward-year earnings is an easy stock to avoid.\\n10 stocks we like better than CrowdStrike\\nWhen our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Any positive results could inspire investors after recent quarters saw Intel’s profits fall amid weak demand for computers and its own heavy spending to regain market leadership. \\nIntel’s Q2 earnings are expected to fall -47 cents a share on revenue of about $12 billion, representing a -22% decline from the year-ago period.  According to Blomberg Intelligence, Intel’s full-year sales are seen falling -18.5%, compared with the decline of -8.9% expected for the chip sector overall.  Intel trades at 2.6 times estimated sales, a discount to its 10-year average and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index ($SOX).\\nDespite expectations of contracting sales and falling revenue, Intel has taken a number of steps to save money and improve profitability, including slowing spending on new plants and cutting its dividend.  Intel’s management also said the company remains on track with its target of regaining manufacturing leadership by 2025, which could be a catalyst for growth.  Sanford C. Bernstein said, “On the other hand, investor interest is shifting away from Intel’s core markets, and the question of what AI and accelerators might mean for the data center CPU market is now garnering more attention.” \\nSome analysts believe the steps that Intel has taken to save money and improve profitability will soon show up in its earnings results.  The Futurum Group said, “While caution is warranted, Intel is trading at an incredibly low multiple, expectations are extremely low, and any signs of strength or growth could lead to a rally on the idea that it was oversold and underpriced.” Also, Citigroup recently opened an upside catalyst watch on Intel, expecting the company’s earnings results to show “upside to estimates from the PC recovery.”\\nMost analysts remain skeptical about a recovery in Intel.  The recommendation consensus on shares of Intel, a proxy for its ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings, is the lowest among the 30 components of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.  Intel’s Xeon chips once accounted for 99% of the server market.  However, the massive ramp-up in artificial intelligence (AI) hardware has data center owners turning to chips made by Nvidia, tripling its stock price this year, and to chips from Advanced Micro Devices, sending its shares soaring 70% compared to a 30% gain this year for Intel. Futurum Group said, “Intel needs to have a role in AI, and it can be a solid beneficiary of AI even if it is number two or three behind Nvidia.”\\n\\n\\nMore Stock Market News from Barchart\\nStocks Rally as Economic News Shows a Resilient U.S. Economy Markets Today: Stocks Soar on the Outlook for a Soft Landing Get An Income Boost From This Popular REIT Stocks Climb Before the Open as Investors Await Key U.S. GDP Data, Meta Results Boost Sentiment\\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Created through machine learning, it is about training a system with ample data to make inferences about all the new data. AI has been around for a few years but since the start of 2023, it seems like it is everywhere. With the need for advanced technology growing, AI has already become a main driver across industries, from robotics to Big Data and the internet of things. It has started to transform the software development space and is going to be huge this year. However, the market is still in the early stages of AI adoption and smart investors know that AI growth stocks are where the potential lies.\\nThere are many artificial intelligence stocks on the market, but only a few have the potential to make it big. If you want to tap into the future of AI, consider pure-play AI stocks for your portfolio. Growing interest and an investment surge in AI makes it an ideal time to take your position. Let’s take a look at the best AI growth stocks to add to your portfolio:\\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\\nOne of the first companies that comes to mind when we think of the best AI growth stocks is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Already a solid player in the industry, Microsoft was recently in the news for increasing its stake in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. The revolutionary tool has shown how far AI can go and how capable it is in generating images, texts, ideas, and sounds. This year, Microsoft made a $10 billion investment, a sizeable increase from its previous investment of $1 billion in 2019.\\nMicrosoft recently added “AI-generated stories” to its Bing search engine to give users a better insight into AI. MSFT stock is trading at $280, up 18% in the past six months, and is inching closer to the 52-week high of $315, making it one of the best artificial intelligence stocks to own today. AI justifies its higher valuation and I believe the company’s investments will pay off in the near term. \\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella sees AI as the next big computing platform and this investment is just step one in the company’s AI transition. Apart from this investment, the company is harnessing the power of AI in multiple ways, including clinical documentation and healthcare. \\nThis month, Microsoft also introduced Dynamics 365 Copilot, a tool designed to assist with many businesses’ day-to-day tasks including marketing, sales, and customer service. The technology is still being tested but, if successful, could transform the current automated chat experience. Microsoft is a proven performer, no matter the state of the tech industry, making it a stock to buy and hold onto.\\nNvidia (NVDA)\\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\\nAnother artificial intelligence stock to watch out for is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). A leader in the graphics chip industry, it is making the most of the AI boom and could become one of the biggest players in the world. Its data center segment has shown a steady rise in the share of the total revenue of the company and managed to top the gaming segment in revenue last year. Despite the drop in tech stocks and the market turmoil, NVDA stock was standing strong because AI was one of the driving forces behind its growth. \\nThe stock is currently trading at $265 and is up more than 100% in the past six months. Nvidia recently launched a set of inference platforms designed for generative AI and its chips are already popular for handling large workloads. Because it has applications that are required to run AI apps, Nvidia should remain in demand and relevant in the upcoming years.\\nIn the upcoming years, Nvidia intends to make self-driving car processors another revenue stream. Since cars with self-driving capabilities gather ample amounts of data from cameras and sensors in real-time, AI is then used to make complex decisions — something Nvidia intends to start contributing to in the next few years. NVDA stock does not come cheap and it is currently trading at 24.8 times sales, but the growth potential is massive.\\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)\\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, is another top artificial intelligence stock to buy for long-term growth. It recently acquired Alter, an AI avatar startup that allows creators and brands to express their virtual identities, for $100 million. In order to get an edge in the AI sector, companies need to make ongoing investments and Alphabet has the liquidity to do so. It also has the experience and resources to make a mark in the AI industry.\\nThe company’s recent history is not without setbacks. Between the partnership of Microsoft with OpenAI and their ChatGPT tool, as well as the relatively unsuccessful launch of Google’s own AI-equipped service, Bard, GOOG stock has taken hits in recent months. However, the company has many years of experience in deep learning and it can help with a smooth transition into AI.\\nGOOGL stock is on sale currently which is also another reason to buy. The stock is trading at $105 today and is down 25% in the past year. Considering its history and growth potential, it is cheap for the tech sector.\\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Unsurprisingly, many centered on artificial intelligence (AI), where Microsoft is perceived to have an early lead thanks to its investment in OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT.\\nHowever, an in-house, custom-designed AI chip is one area Microsoft has lacked. That is, until Wednesday when it unveiled the company\\'s first custom AI accelerator and CPU processor. Given Microsoft\\'s clout as a top AI cloud provider, a new custom chip has the potential to shake up the AI market and the fortunes of several key players.\\nMeet Maia\\nAt the event, Microsoft unveiled Maia, its new AI accelerator. Like other cloud providers with custom chips, Microsoft will likely market Maia for customers looking to save money on AI training and inference workloads and who don\\'t wish to pay up for expensive Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs).\\nThis year, Nvidia\\'s revenue exploded as its early dominance of the AI market allowed it to capture a huge market share. Some estimate that Nvidia has 80% to 95% of the AI GPU market today. Since it is the clear leader, at least for now, Nvidia has been able to charge as much as $30,000 per chip or more. That has made AI an expensive endeavor for Microsoft and its customers.\\nOther cloud providers, like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), are multiple generations into their own custom chips, with Amazon\\'s Trainium and Inferentia chips proprietary to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google\\'s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) chips serving as lower-cost alternatives to Nvidia.\\nCloud customers using these chips get lower costs in two important ways. First, cloud providers don\\'t have to pay Nvidia\\'s markup -- Nvidia did make 50% net margins last quarter, after all. Second, cloud providers that design their chips in-house can better optimize those chips for their hardware, infrastructure, software, and algorithms, running these chips most efficiently.\\nAnother related cost-saving tactic is that Maia and other non-Nvidia chips can run on lower-cost Ethernet networking equipment versus Nvidia\\'s expensive, customized Infiniband networking infrastructure. For Maia, this was a key point of discussion at Ignite. Brian Harry, a hardware executive at Microsoft, noted, \"Azure Maia was specifically designed for AI and for achieving the absolute maximum utilization of the hardware.\"\\nMicrosoft has had a lot of practice optimizing its tech stack, from its software on top of its cloud platform to its own servers and other related hardware. In fact, Microsoft even disclosed it had developed a new kind of unique server rack with liquid cooling built into it for both Maia and other AI accelerators going forward. Now, with its own AI chip designed in-house, Microsoft will be able to optimize down to the chip level so that, basically, all levels of its cloud AI stack work efficiently together.\\nOpenAI has actually played a role in helping Microsoft design its chips so OpenAI\\'s leading AI models and algorithms can run in an optimized fashion on new chips. In the release, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman noted:\\nWe were excited when Microsoft first shared their designs for the Maia chip, and we\\'ve worked together to refine and test it with our models. Azure\\'s end-to-end AI architecture, now optimized down to the silicon with Maia, paves the way for training more capable models and making those models cheaper for our customers.\\nImage source: Microsoft.\\nMeet Cobalt\\nIn addition to Maia, Microsoft also unveiled its own Arm-based data center CPU called Cobalt. Cobalt was designed for general processing and, perhaps, some AI-related tasks, such as inferencing smaller models, akin to generalized data center CPUs from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).\\nCobalt is really Microsoft\\'s answer to Amazon\\'s in-house Graviton CPU. The Graviton CPU has received wide adoption from cloud customers who, again, are looking to save money on cloud computing costs by going to Graviton versus Intel or AMD. An Amazon spokesman recently disclosed that AWS had 50,000 cloud customers running workloads on Graviton chips as customers have looked to optimize their spending and cut costs amid tough economic conditions.\\nSo, Cobalt was developed in response to lower costs for all the same reasons as Maia -- taking out third-party vendor margins while optimizing the chip for one\\'s own infrastructure.\\nHow this affects other AI giants\\nObviously, if Microsoft\\'s new chips prove successful, that would be a competitive blow to others in the AI ecosystem. It would increase Microsoft\\'s competitiveness versus AWS and Google, which have been able to sell cloud customers on the unique cost-saving measures of their in-house accelerators and processors.\\nThere will also likely be some impact on AI GPU market share, affecting Nvidia and AMD. Now, that might not be quite so big of a deal if the AI processor market grows as large as some think it will. If the AI accelerator market grows at a 50% annualized rate for the next five years to reach $150 billion by 2027, as some think, that rising tide could lift all boats.\\nMoreover, even though Microsoft announced Maia on Wednesday, it announced it would be deploying new Nvidia H100 and AMD MI300 systems as well, with a pre-announcement for Nvidia H200 system availability sometime next year. So, there will still be plenty of space for generalized AI accelerators in Microsoft\\'s cloud.\\nNvidia has touted its chips\\' versatility and developer ecosystem as advantages over in-house-designed chips that may only be optimized for a single cloud setting. Given Nvidia\\'s outsize market share, that seems to hold true. Still, if Microsoft could get even a couple of points of market share in GPU workloads, it would benefit, while Nvidia wouldn\\'t be affected much.\\nHowever, Maia may be more dangerous for AMD. AMD is now trying to make a name for itself as a competitor to Nvidia\\'s dominant generalized AI chips and is really starting almost from scratch. So, if Microsoft and other cloud companies can execute, that may crowd out the need for AMD\\'s alternative. AMD will undoubtedly gain some share, but another in-house chip from another cloud provider isn\\'t doing it any favors.\\nIn sum, these new Microsoft chips weren\\'t unexpected, but they\\'re still a blow to competitors Amazon and Google, and they also might limit AMD\\'s ability to get a bigger foothold in the AI chip market. While Nvidia may also be affected, it will probably only be around the edges.\\nSo, while Nvidia sold off slightly on Wednesday in the wake of this news, Microsoft\\'s Maia probably shouldn\\'t be too much to worry about for the AI chip leader -- at least not yet.\\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft\\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Companies generally opt to split their stocks because share prices reach elevated levels because of outsized investor interest. But in many cases, these companies that break up their stock structures to create more shares priced more reasonably end up continuing the buying momentum. While stock splits don't do anything to change a company's fundamentals, lowering the price of shares can make buying more appealing to a wider range of investors and increase trading volume.\\nLately, the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has pushed share prices for some top tech companies to lofty levels over the last year, and the discussion in the markets has turned to whether some of these big-name stocks will opt to carry out splits soon.\\nIf you're in the hunt for top AI stocks that could potentially score extra momentum through an upcoming stock split, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors believe that investing in these two potential stock-splitting companies before December is over would be a smart move.\\nNvidia's stock price is high enough to consider a split\\nParkev Tatevosian (Nvidia): For me, a stock split is no reason to buy a stock. However, at $462 per share, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) management might want to consider splitting its stock.\\nNvidia is on the leading edge of AI technology while earning phenomenal profits and trading at a relatively fair valuation. A stock split could bring added attention to a stock already getting a lot of attention. The more affordable per-share price after splitting could attract more retail investors who missed out on the stock when shares were priced at more reasonable levels before its big 2023 run-up.\\nNvidia is showing the benefits of investing in AI technology. Revenue increased 102% and 206% year over year in its two most recent quarters, respectively. That revenue growth brought with it improved profitability. Nvidia's operating income jumped to $6.8 billion and $10.4 billion in the two quarters. Those figures were up from $499 million and $601 million in the comparative quarters the year prior. The growth in revenue and profit has been explosive for Nvidia, thanks to AI.\\nMeanwhile, Nvidia's stock is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6, a valuation I expect to pay for a company with less impressive performance and prospects. Nvidia's front-row position in the growth of the AI market, premium profitability, and reasonable valuation make it one stock investors can buy with enthusiasm in December.\\nASML's tech is making advanced AI possible\\nKeith Noonan (ASML): ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) stock has climbed roughly 19% over the last year. Compared to the returns posted by some other influential AI companies, the semiconductor equipment leader's gains might not look like much -- but they have pushed the tech specialist's share price to levels that may be dissuading some investors.\\nWith the stock trading at roughly $711 per share as of this writing, I think that ASML stands out as a prime candidate for a stock split. For reference, Apple announced its last stock split in 2020 -- when its stock was trading at approximately $380 per share. When Tesla announced its most recent split in 2022, its stock was trading at $864 per share.\\nASML's current share price is squarely within the range where a split could make sense, but that's far from the main reason why I think that investors should build a position in the stock.\\nEven with excitement for AI surging, ASML's stock performance over the last year hasn't exactly blown past the 17% gain posted by the S&P 500 index.\\nWhy hasn't the semiconductor equipment specialist dramatically outperformed the benchmark index? The big reason is that the global chip industry is actually going through a cyclical downturn. Despite surging AI demand, demand for chips to power mobile hardware, automobiles, and other key product categories has actually been relatively soft.\\nBut it's important to keep the cyclical nature of the chip in mind. The overall semiconductor industry should enter another growth phase before too long -- this time with the added benefit of AI-driven demand. And ASML is perfectly positioned to benefit.\\nThe company's lithography machines are essential for the manufacturing of the high-performance semiconductors that are powering the artificial intelligence revolution. The fabrication of Nvidia's most advanced processors would be impossible without ASML's extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines -- and patents essentially give the company a monopoly on the tech.\\nFor investors seeking AI stocks that have plenty of long-term upside and non-prohibitive risk profiles, I think ASML has what it takes to be a great portfolio addition.\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

It makes sense that investors are looking to cash in on this opportunity, and AI stocks are dominating market conversations.\\nAs with any hot new trend, there are going to be winners and losers. How can you know in advance? At the very least, it doesn't make sense to jump onto the AI bandwagon unless you're looking at a stock with long-term potential. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a top AI stock, and it's already up over 50% this year. But it can keep going -- here's why.\\nNo competition in retail\\nThere is simply no company on this planet that can compete with Amazon's e-commerce operations right now. Amazon has nearly 40% of the total U.S. e-commerce market with its closest competitor at around 6%.\\nBut Amazon is aiming for more. It continues to pad its moat and make it an uphill battle for any competitor to take market share. It already has a robust third-party marketplace that accounts for more than half of its total e-commerce sales, and it makes acquisitions left and right to add value to its platform.\\nIt has powerful AI capabilities that drive its retail business and inform everything from product selection and recommendations, which generate clicks and purchases, to cheap and fast delivery. Amazon is the original one-day delivery company, and even today, when this is no longer an innovation but an expectation, there are few e-commerce companies out there that can offer this service. Amazon's size and fulfillment network make it a reality that it can achieve, but smaller companies simply don't have the ability to offer it, creating a cycle that benefits Amazon.\\nAmazon's retail unit has underperformed in recent months for a variety of reasons, notably because there's too much infrastructure bogging down the bottom line, and Amazon is trying to build on top of massive pandemic growth. But it's making progress in restructuring to meet demand. Expect the stock to rise as sales growth increases and profitability improves.\\nAI for AWS\\nAmazon's most potent AI brews are being formulated to drive incredible growth at Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon announced new generative-AI applications for AWS that can do an astounding amount of human-like work when prompted, and this could have serious ramifications for developers.\\nThe new systems are based on foundation models, which are basically machine-learning models that are so large that they can go from learning to applying. They have so much information analyzed that they can go to the next stage, which is doing the work of the generative part of the process.\\nAnd because the new systems are trained on so much general information, users can develop all sorts of content, including copy, branding, and social media campaigns, tied to their unique needs without having to input their company-specific data.\\nAmazon also released an application, called Code Whisperer, that allows developers to put in a prompt for code. This could be game-changing for developers, who could free up their time for the creative part of the process while Amazon's technology does the actual coding.\\nAWS has been capturing greater market share and is already the largest cloud-computing company. Sales growth, once reliable as the highest of Amazon's segments, is slowing in this sluggish economy. But between its No. 1 spot and these new applications, Amazon is well positioned to shoot forward when client companies rebound.\\nNo end in sight for new opportunities\\nOne of the most compelling Amazon opportunities right now is in advertising. The company is using sophisticated AI algorithms for pinpoint accuracy, which yields the rights ads for the right customers, resulting in higher conversion rates. It accomplishes this by tabulating hundreds of millions of product-embedding requests every second, and processing them at the same time. It's a bit mind-boggling, which is why it's left to AI, which has bandwidth and capabilities outside of any human, and most technology.\\nAs the largest e-commerce operation in the U.S., Amazon has one of the largest audiences possible for running ads, making its ad business a no-brainer for retailers looking to stimulate sales growth. Ad sales increased 23% over last year in the 2023 first quarter and were the highest-growing category of all of Amazon's businesses. CEO Andy Jassy explained that the ad business is growing because of the machine-learning investments that deliver targeted results for shoppers.\\nAs Amazon continues to rebound and harness new opportunities, it's standing out as an AI stock with a solid track record that you'll want to own going forward.\\nFind out why Amazon.com is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\\nOur analyst team has spent more than a decade beating the market.

In fact, the top AI stocks have played an enormous role in the stock market’s robust returns so far this year.\\nWhile the S&P 500 was searching for direction in the first quarter, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were bombarding higher as catalyst after catalyst continued to pave the way for its AI advances. Together, the duo now accounts for more than $3.6 trillion in combined market capitalizations.\\nHowever, they have ignited plenty of other stocks higher along the way, too. Some of these firms are well-known tech companies. Others are smaller, lesser-known entities in the high-growth space. Either way, the trend remains robust.\\nEarlier this year, Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller said AI could be as “transformative as the internet.” If that’s the case, let’s look at a few of the top AI stocks to buy now.\\nAI Stocks to Dominate: Nvidia (NVDA)\\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\\nThere’s no denying that Nvidia is the most dominant name in AI right now. In some measures, it has no competition, so while its stock gains are astronomical (and even somewhat comical), what’s going to stop Nvidia from printing money at this moment?\\nNothing!\\nShares are currently up more than 215% so far this year and up more than 300% from the 2022 lows. Going into earnings in late May, the stock was up almost 110%, and the bullish bets had been piling up. I distinctly remember most investors assuming it couldn’t go much higher, as it had made up almost all of its bear market losses and run a great deal going into the event.\\nThen the company blew out expectations, while management guided for current-quarter revenue of roughly $11 billion vs. expectations of just $7 billion, and the stock erupted. Shares closed higher by almost 25% the next day and have now climbed 50% since that report.\\nMy point is, what if Nvidia has another massive revenue guidance this quarter? What company is stepping in to soak up the excess demand for its AI chips?\\nFor now, Nvidia remains at the forefront of AI domination.\\nBest Machine Learning Stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG)\\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\\nChatGPT is owned by OpenAI, a firm that Microsoft had invested in previously but made another big investment in earlier this year. That’s as the company’s ChatGPT platform exploded in popularity, garnering more than 100 million active users in record time.\\nIn the minds of investors, that made Microsoft a top AI play seemingly overnight. To pour salt on the wound for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), the company had a somewhat embarrassing gaff with its own AI chat platform, Bard.\\nNow, there are a few things to take note of here.\\nFirst, Alphabet hasn’t been the best at building out platforms outside of Google and YouTube — the top two websites in the world. It failed at social media, and its phone will never displace Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. It lags in streaming video and streaming music.\\nSo one might wonder just how Alphabet’s Bard is going to displace ChatGPT. Well, it may never. However, if the company integrates the platform with Google, it should become one of the best machine-learning stocks on the planet.\\n“Google” has become a verb, and Google.com is the most popular website in the world (literally). Assuming Alphabet can successfully incorporate AI into its Chrome browser — which tops theglobal marketshare — and its Google search platform, it will become a dominant AI stock.\\nTop AI Stocks of the Future: Baidu (BIDU)\\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\\nIf you read the above passage on Alphabet and are receptive to Chinese-listed equities, you might love Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU).\\nThe firm sits with a market capitalization of about $52 billion. In other words, Alphabet is almost 30 times larger. However, the opportunity here is interesting.\\nLike Alphabet, Baidu is an internet search platform. However, because Google can’t operate in China, another company has to pick up the slack — that company being Baidu. It’s the No. 6 website in the world and the top website in China.\\nThat makes it incredibly valuable, even if U.S. investors aren’t that familiar with the name. Analysts expect about 13% earnings growth this year and next year while shares trade at about 15 times earnings.\\nEven if BIDU stock doubled from current levels, it still wouldn’t make new highs. That highlights the lacking love from the market and the stock’s upside potential. However, if it’s the next one to take off due to AI, it could have a lot of runway.\\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

By all accounts, 2022 was the worst year for investors in over a decade, with the major market indexes posting their worst performances since 2008. Now, just six months later, it appears the worst has passed.\\nEach of the major market indexes is up more than 20% from their recent respective bottoms, with some pundits calling this a new bull market. Helping drive the about-face is recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The debut of ChatGPT helped illustrate the potentially far-reaching applications for generative AI, foreshadowing its widespread adoption.\\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) was one of the beneficiaries of the recent AI gold rush, and its stock trades up more than 41% so far this year, more than two and a half times the gains of the S&P 500. While some investors fear the stock has come too far, too fast, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives believes Microsoft stock will continue its upward trajectory and join Apple in the exclusive $3 trillion market cap club by early 2024. Here\\'s why.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nThe search is on\\nMicrosoft is a leading provider of enterprise software and cloud computing services. As such, the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from the accelerating adoption of AI. Microsoft took a decisive step early this year when it added to its existing investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, bringing the total to more than $13 billion.\\nThe company also made the strategic decision to integrate ChatGPT into its Bing search engine. Microsoft estimates that every 1% of market share gains in search will represent a $2 billion revenue opportunity.\\nHowever, it\\'s the integration of AI into the other aspects of Microsoft\\'s business that represents the most significant opportunity.\\nIts head is in the clouds\\nIves said in a recent analyst note that Microsoft is leading the \"AI arms race, with monetization the next step.\" As one of the Big Three cloud providers, Microsoft\\'s Azure cloud provides the company with the perfect opportunity to offer AI to the masses. Ives notes this process won\\'t \"be built overnight\" and Microsoft will introduce additional beta programs, as it \"figures out the pricing and consumption model for enterprises.\" He added:\\nWe estimate for every $100 of cloud Azure spend with Microsoft [over] the last few years, there is an incremental $35 [to] $40 of AI spend that now is on the table, which changes the game and [total addressable market].\\nMicrosoft got the jump on the competition by quickly embracing and integrating generational AI and ChatGPT into its cloud offerings. As a result, Ives says, \"The monetization opportunities around deploying AI and ChatGPT in the cloud is a transformational opportunity across the industry, with [Microsoft] in the driver\\'s seat.\"\\nFurthermore, since Microsoft is one of the leading software providers to enterprises, the company also has the opportunity to layer AI functionality into Office 365, Dynamics, Teams, and more.\\nFinally, Ives cites the \"jaw-dropping guidance heard around the world\" from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) as a \"direct AI barometer\" for Microsoft. In late May, Nvidia provided a forecast for its fiscal 2024 second quarter (which ends July 31), guiding for revenue of roughly $11 billion, up 64% year over year and 53% sequentially.\\nNvidia controls an estimated 95% of the market for the advanced processors used in machine learning (a branch of AI), according to data provided by New Market Research. This makes the company a fitting gauge for estimating the accelerating demand for AI.\\nSo should investors consider Microsoft?\\nMicrosoft\\'s significant move so far this year resulted in a commensurate increase in its valuation. The stock is selling for 37 times earnings and 12 times sales, so it\\'s no longer the screaming bargain it was earlier this year. However, if Ives is correct in his assessment -- and I firmly believe he is -- the additional revenue and profits from its AI initiatives could help Microsoft quickly grow into this valuation.\\nBesides, it will only take stock price gains of roughly 18% from Monday\\'s closing price for Microsoft to surpass a market cap of $3 trillion -- so this benchmark is well within range, and it\\'s likely only a matter of time.\\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft\\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here Are 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks She Likes More', 'date': datetime.datetime(2023, 9, 28, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), 'article': 'No one can claim that Cathie Wood isn\\'t bullish about artificial intelligence (AI). She has been a vocal cheerleader for AI for years, and her Ark Invest funds have invested heavily in AI stocks.\\nHowever, there\\'s one high-flying AI stock that Wood isn\\'t so bullish about these days. She recently spoke at an investor conference in Munich, Germany, where she made two big knocks against Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Wood also talked up two AI stocks that she likes more right now.\\nTwo big knocks against Nvidia\\nWood\\'s first knock against Nvidia at the Munich conference isn\\'t surprising. She noted that the stock is \"easy, but it\\'s also really expensive.\" That isn\\'t the first time she\\'s commented about the chipmaker\\'s steep valuation. On May 29, Wood tweeted that Nvidia was \"priced ahead of the curve.\" At the time, the stock was up 167% year to date. It\\'s even higher now.\\nHer second big knock against Nvidia was that it\\'s \"very obvious.\" What did Wood mean by that comment? Pretty much every investor knows that Nvidia is benefiting from the generative AI boom. She said that Ark Invest is \"really focused on those companies that most people aren\\'t talking about right now.\"\\nAgain, this isn\\'t a surprise. Ark Invest issued a report last month that focused on the valuations of AI stocks. The report acknowledged that Nvidia \"is likely to remain a prime enabler and beneficiary of continued breakthroughs in AI.\" However, it added that \"many other potential beneficiaries are not well understood, may sell at much lower valuations, and potentially could deliver significant revenue and earnings surprises on the high side of expectations.\"\\nTwo better AI picks, according to Wood\\nSo what are some of those AI stocks that few investors are talking about right now that Wood likes more than Nvidia? She singled out two at the Munich conference: Twilio (NYSE: TWLO) and UiPath (NYSE: PATH).\\nTwilio markets a customer engagement platform that gives developers customizable APIs (application programming interfaces) to integrate real-time communications within their software applications.\\nCustomer communications is a natural application for generative AI. Ark Invest believes that Twilio is ideally positioned to lead the way. Twilio is certainly focused on AI. CEO Jeff Lawson said in the company\\'s second-quarter conference call that Twilio is using large language models to \"help customers enter the AI race multiple steps ahead of their peers.\"\\nUiPath is a leader in robotic process automation (RPA). The company\\'s objective for its RPA platform is to perform any task a person does digitally faster and more consistently.\\nArk Invest thinks that UiPath has a key advantage over rivals in the RPA market with its low-code, no-code interfaces. It\\'s not the only big-name fan of UiPath. Alphabet has invested in the company, holding over 14 million shares as of June 30. Google Cloud is also partnered with UiPath.\\nWood said she believes in these lesser-known AI stocks enough to put a lot of money into them. Twilio now ranks as the eighth-largest position across all of Ark Invest\\'s portfolio. UiPath is the second-biggest holding.\\nWhy Wood could be right\\nThere\\'s no question that Wood is right about Nvidia being an \"obvious\" AI pick. She\\'s also correct that the stock sports a high valuation. Even after its recent pullback, Nvidia still trades at nearly 40 times expected earnings.\\nBut is Wood also right about Twilio and UiPath? Maybe. Both companies could have tremendous long-term growth prospects. It\\'s not hard to envision AI providing huge tailwinds for Twilio\\'s customer engagement platform and UiPath\\'s RPA platform.\\nHowever, neither Twilio nor UiPath is all that cheap right now, based on their forward earnings multiples. Wood clearly thinks the two companies will be able to deliver enough growth to justify those valuations. She correctly predicted that Nvidia would be a big winner years ago. She just might be on target about these two AI stocks as well.\\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia\\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It requires that we find stocks that will have a long-term advantage from trends that are ongoing now. While artificial intelligence (AI) is a concept that has been around for decades, AI is only now starting become a tangible asset to business operations. That makes now an ideal time to seek and bet on AI stocks.\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n  Today we examine IBM (NYSE:), Amazon (NASDAQ:) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:GOOGL). These are three companies that are already using AI, but more importantly, will continue to benefit from it at an exponential rate.\\nBecause of the impact of AI, I can own IBM, AMZN and GOOGL stock for the next decade.\\nThis week, the stock markets are still near all-time highs with so much trepidation stemming from the political rhetoric. We are still awaiting the news from the Federal Reserve to see if they will cut rates and by how much.\\nWe also have activity along the negotiation efforts between the U.S. and China. The progress there is slow and unfruitful, so it’s more likely to be a headwind than help to stocks.\\nWe are also in the middle of an earnings season with more mega caps ready to report. So the short-term moves in Amazon, Alphabet and IBM stock are likely to be more binary than fundamentally driven.\\nWith all of that in mind, here’s more information about each of these hot AI stocks to buy now.\\n  IBM (IBM)\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n  For decades, IBM has been the face of AI. I remember as a kid reading about a machine competing with humans in the game of chess. And even then, the concept of machines thinking on their own fascinated us.\\nWhile it may sound simple, machine learning is a complicated process. We can program a machine to hone its skills in one task, but it is another thing to give it the initiative to teach itself a new skill to achieve its task without any human intervention.\\nAnd that’s where IBM shines. It has a giant head start on most other mega-cap companies in this area, so it is the AI stock to own.\\nI would like it even more if it shook up its management ranks, but that will come with time if it continues to languish in bad earnings results. Its trend there has been very disappointing and eventually the equity markets will demand results or force a change. Nevertheless, I can accumulate a position in it for the years to come.\\nLuckily IBM stock is cheap as it sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 12 and pays a 4% .\\n  Amazon (AMZN)\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n  There is little that Amazon cannot do. It has dominated many industries and it keeps trying to find new ones to tap into. AI could be one of these areas\\nBut what AMZN does better than finding new business to disrupt is to know when to quit and acquire the technology that is better than its own. So, I anticipate that AMZN will use AI even more to streamline its operations.\\nThis will have a tremendous impact on AMZN stock as it continues to flourish against many skeptics. Under the leadership of Jeff Bezos, AMZN has proven all its doubters wrong.\\nThe fundamentals in AMZN stock have improved tremendously over the years. It is now profitable while it continues to spend heavily to maintain its growth. So the fact that it sells at P/E of 80 is an asset, not a liability. Hyper growth companies like AMZN should spend a lot to grow.\\nArtificial intelligence and AMZN’s voice technology Alexa are a marriage made in heaven. I bet that it will be on board many machines that run our daily lives in the years to come.\\n  Alphabet (GOOGL)\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n  GOOGL is a behemoth in advertising but it also dabbles in other areas. One of those is the Autonomous driving space. Its subsidiary Waymo is the leader there and will likely be one of the first commercial providers of self driving cars to the masses.\\nSo from that perspective it’s easy to see why it is a good idea to own GOOGL stock now for the next ten years. Self driving technology is all about artificial intelligence; it cannot exist without it as cars need to monitor and adjust to unpredictable variables every second. GOOGL is definitely an AI stock\\nMeanwhile, this is a company that still dominates advertising, especially mobile. So while investors wait for the AI impact they have all the benefits of Alphabet’s leadership now.\\nThe good news is that the price and value of GOOGL stock is humble. It is three times cheaper than AMZN. So buying GOOGL now is not likely to be a colossal financial disaster, especially if the goal is to own it for the long term.\\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of .

Let\\'s look at that catalyst and see how it could help Palo Alto maintain its outstanding growth.\\nPalo Alto sees AI as a big driver for its business\\nOn May 23, Palo Alto released its fiscal 2023 third-quarter results (for the three months ended April 30). The company clocked impressive growth, with revenue jumping 24% year over year to $1.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surging 83% to $1.10. More importantly, management increased its full-year growth forecasts for revenue, billings, and earnings.\\nThe company now expects to deliver full-year EPS of $4.27 as compared to its earlier prediction of $4. The billings guidance has now been bumped to $9.2 billion at the midpoint from $9.15 billion earlier. Palo Alto has also increased the lower end of its fiscal 2023 revenue guidance from $6.85 billion to $6.88 billion. Revenue is on track to increase between 25% and 26% this fiscal year.\\nThe company\\'s better-than-expected performance isn\\'t surprising given the health of the cybersecurity sector. Market research firm IDC estimates that global cybersecurity spending could increase 12% in 2023 to $219 billion as compared to last year. IDC also expects that global cybersecurity spending could cross $300 billion by 2026.\\nSo, Palo Alto is growing at a faster pace than the cybersecurity market -- not surprising since the company latched on to the artificial intelligence (AI) gravy train before the technology started taking off. According to CEO Nikesh Arora on the company\\'s latest earnings conference call:\\nWe first introduced machine-learning capabilities as part of our WildFire offering seven years ago. In the ensuing years, we added AI and machine-learning capabilities across our network security portfolio, and it has been a critical driver of our innovation and differentiation in the market. In 2020, we introduced the industry\\'s first machine-learning-powered next-generation firewall, where machine-learning detection moved in line to prevent zero-day attacks. Since then, we have overhauled nearly all of our security subscriptions with advanced AI capabilities...\\nAnd now, Palo Alto seems to be reaping the rewards of its early AI push, as its impressive growth and guidance tell us. More important, Palo Alto\\'s AI capabilities should pave the way for solid long-term growth given the increasing application of this tech in cybersecurity.\\nAccording to market research firm BlueWeave Consulting, the application of AI in cybersecurity is expected to grow at an annual pace of 21% through 2029 and generate $79 billion in annual revenue. That would be 3.5 times the size of the AI-enabled cybersecurity market last year.\\nNot surprisingly, Palo Alto focused big time on this technology on its latest call, with the term \"AI\" being mentioned 38 times. Management said that AI is driving \"tangible customer benefits\" by blocking 8.6 billion cyberattacks across its customer base daily. The company analyzes 750 million new and unique objects every day to train its AI algorithms, and that helps it detect 1.5 million new and unique attacks each day.\\nAll this indicates that Palo Alto is set to make the most of the growing deployment of AI in cybersecurity, which should drive strong top- and bottom-line growth for the company.\\nHow much more gains can this hot stock deliver?\\nPalo Alto has built up a solid revenue pipeline thanks to growth in customer spending and the addition of new customers. Last quarter, the company reported remaining performance obligations (RPO) worth $9.2 billion, a jump of 35% over the prior-year period. This metric grew much faster than the company\\'s revenue, which points toward a bright future because RPO refers to the total value of contracts that the company hasn\\'t fulfilled yet.\\nOnce the company executes those contracts, the RPO will be recognized as revenue. It is worth noting that Palo Alto\\'s RPO is significantly higher than the revenue that the company is expected to deliver this fiscal year. That should set the stage for stronger growth in the coming years as well.\\nPANW revenue estimates for current fiscal year, data by YCharts.\\nThe chart above indicates that Palo Alto\\'s top line could hit $10 billion at the end of fiscal 2025. Catalysts such as AI could help it deliver higher revenue than analysts are anticipating. But even if Palo Alto\\'s revenue increases to $10 billion in fiscal 2025 and it continues to trade at 10.7 times sales, like it does right now, its market cap could jump to $107 billion after a couple of years. That would translate into a 67% jump from current levels.\\nOf course, the sales multiple used in the calculation above is on the expensive side considering that Palo Alto has averaged a price-to-sales ratio of 8.6 in the past five years. But the stock\\'s rich multiple seems justified given that it is growing at a faster pace than the industry it operates in and is sitting on a massive driver in AI that could supercharge its growth in the future.\\n10 stocks we like better than Palo Alto Networks\\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

His Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund has been a big winner since Ackman founded it in 2004.\\nWhat\\'s Ackman\\'s secret to success? It really isn\\'t such a secret. The billionaire has never shied away from discussing his approach to investing. Ackman explained his eight \"basic commandments\" of investing in an interview released last week on The Julia La Roche Show podcast. And there\\'s one artificial intelligence (AI) stock that could check off all of them.\\nAckman\\'s eight commandments\\nDuring the podcast, Ackman held up his commandments, which are engraved on stone tablets and sit on the desks of the Pershing Square team. They detail his criteria for selecting the best stocks.\\nWhile Ackman gave a brief explanation in the interview last week, he has shared all eight commandments in the past. Here they are:\\nThe business must be simple and predictable.\\nIt must generate free cash flow.\\nThe company must have a dominant market position.\\nThere must be large barriers to entry for rivals (i.e., the business should have a moat).\\nThe company must generate a high return on capital.\\nThe business must have limited exposure to uncontrollable extrinsic risks.\\nThe company must have a strong balance sheet without needing access to capital to survive.\\nIt must have excellent management and good governance.\\nAckman summarized his investment philosophy in one statement, \"We want to buy the best businesses in the world.\" He also stressed the importance of buying them \"at attractive prices.\"\\nChecking all the boxes?\\nThe obvious question for investors who aren\\'t billionaires is: Which stocks meet all of those criteria? Ackman doesn\\'t seem to think there are many. His Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund owns only eight stocks. Two of them are the class A and class C shares of the same AI leader -- Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\\nSome might quibble with the view that Alphabet\\'s business is \"simple and predictable.\" While it\\'s true that the way that the technology the company uses isn\\'t simple, its underlying business model actually is quite straightforward.\\nThere\\'s certainly no question about Alphabet fulfilling all of Ackman\\'s financial commandments. It generated free cash flow of more than $68 billion over the last 12 months. The company\\'s return on invested capital is over 26%. Alphabet\\'s balance sheet is exceptionally strong, with a cash stockpile of more than $118 billion.\\nAlphabet clearly dominates most of the markets it\\'s in, especially online search. It also has demonstrated a solid moat, as evidenced by the difficulty that even deep-pocketed rivals have had in gaining market share.\\nAs for excellent management, some would simply point to Alphabet\\'s track record. The stock has delivered a 6x return over the last decade and is up more than 50% so far in 2023.\\nA couple of controversies\\nNot everyone would agree that Alphabet checks off all of Ackman\\'s eight commandments, though. Two key areas of controversy are the company\\'s governance and its potential risk of disruption by AI.\\nInstitutional Shareholder Services\\' (ISS) most recent score of Alphabet\\'s governance indicates a high level of governance risk for the company. ISS and another shareholder advisory firm, Glass Lewis, have pushed Alphabet for governance changes this year, including calling for replacing two members of the company\\'s board of directors.\\nOthers argue that Alphabet faces a huge threat from AI. They think that generative AI could eliminate the need for search and potentially crush Alphabet\\'s advertising revenue.\\nAckman, though, believes those fears are way overblown. In his view, generative AI will enhance Google Search. He sees Alphabet\\'s massive amount of data related to consumer behavior and online searches gives it great training data for AI apps. The billionaire also points to Alphabet\\'s track record of AI leadership and significant investments in AI.\\nHis bet on Alphabet has paid off nicely so far this year. Ackman and his Pershing Square team continue to predict \"significant upside\" for the high-flying stock.\\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And its use is simple. Once you’re on the chatbot’s public website and have created an account, all you have to do is type your question into its search bar, and you get your answer.\\nAnd, folks, I even tested it out. When I asked it to describe itself, the AI chatbot said:\\nOpenAI, ChatGPT’s developer, is a non-profit AI research company. It launched the chatbot last November with huge success. ChatGPT crossed one million users in its first week, and went up to 21 million in December. It’s now considered the paradigm of how extensive and influential AI-generated content can be.\\nSo, in today’s Market 360 – which, don’t worry, wasn’t written by AI – let’s dive into Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI and then review the company’s second-quarter earnings.\\nMicrosoft first partnered with OpenAI back in July 2019. Microsoft invested $1 billion into the research company, and its cloud service Azure became OpenAI’s exclusive cloud provider. The plan between the two companies was to build AI that could solve more complex tasks, such as “more personalized healthcare and education.”\\nMicrosoft invested in OpenAI again in 2021 and did so for a third time last Monday. Microsoft announced a new $10 billion, multiyear deal with the ChatGPT maker. This renewed partnership could pave the way for Microsoft to incorporate the chatbot AI into its applications, like Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook.\\nThe partnership comes with more than a multibillion-dollar cost, though. Microsoft also announced last week that it plans on laying off 10,000 employees as part of cost-cutting measures.\\nFurther, ChatGPT isn’t foolproof. It can give inaccurate information or biased answers about an issue. And it can – at least for now – only provide users with information prior to 2021, because that’s the year its training stopped.\\nIn fact, I had also asked ChatGPT the question I started with here: What was Microsoft’s second-quarter earnings? But since the current earnings are for fiscal year 2023, it couldn’t give me the most up-to-date numbers.\\nA Look at Microsoft’s Earnings\\nSo, how exactly did Microsoft fare in its second quarter?\\nMicrosoft reported earnings of $2.32 per share, down 7% year-over-year from earnings of $2.48 per share, but beat analysts’ estimates of $2.29 per share. Revenue of $52.75billion was up slightly from $51.73billion a year ago, but missed analysts’ estimates of $52.94 billion. Microsoft’s Cloud business rose 18% year-over-year to $21.51 billion, topping analysts’ expectations for $21.44 billion. Total revenue increased 2%, which is the slowest rate since 2016.\\nThe stock jumped 4% in after-hours trading on the earnings and cloud revenue beat on Tuesday, but it took a turn once the company’s poor forward-looking guidance was released.\\nFor the third quarter, Microsoft anticipates revenue of $50.5 billion to $51.5 billion, a potential 4% decrease from the second quarter, while analysts forecasted revenue of $52.43 billion. Earnings per share are forecast to come in at $2.32, up from earnings per share of $2.22 a year ago, but flatlining from the second quarter.\\nHowever, company management remains optimistic about the company’s future, saying in a statement:\\nThe age of AI is upon us, and Microsoft is powering it…We have the most powerful AI supercomputing infrastructure in the cloud. It’s being used by customers and partners, like OpenAI, to train state of the art models and services, including ChatGPT.\\nAnd Microsoft is getting another partner in AI: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\\nLast November, NVIDIA announced it is teaming up with Microsoft for a multi-year collaboration to build “one of the most powerful AI computers in the world.” NVDIA is a leading computer graphics company, making graphic processing units (GPUs) for consumers and businesses. From video games to professional visualization, datacenter and automotive applications, NVIDIA’s graphics cards enhance the processing capability of its users’ computers.\\nChipmakers are critical for different AI innovations, and right now NVIDIA is at the forefront of helping to develop autonomous vehicles.\\nFor example, the AI platform to help build automobiles for Foxconn, which makes the iPhones, is well respected. In fact, NVIDIA’s AI platform is used to help build vehicles for Foxconn, and its chips are utilized in all Mercedes systems. Basically, NVIDIA is pioneering self-driving and is taking the lead over Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).\\nHere’s why:\\nThe Tesla system uses cameras. The NVIDIA system will use cameras, but especially LIDAR. Well, what’s LIDAR? It’s a forward infrared radar. It’s what the military uses to send missiles through smoke and rain and things like that so they can be accurate.\\nWhen I order a car out West, I always order a LIDAR system because I want to see the animals at night. If infrared sees an animal, it will stop the vehicle. Tesla got away from LIDAR, so when a Tesla gets in heavy rain, sleet, snow, ice, fog or smoke, the system doesn’t work.\\nThe bottom line is NVIDIA is the AI and graphic chips leader.\\nRegarding its fundamentals, the company is expected to release its fourth-quarter earnings for fiscal year 2023 on February 22. Earnings are projected to decline 38.6% year-over-year to $1.32 per share, down from earnings of $1.32 per share, while revenue is projected to drop 21.4% year-over-year to $6.01 billion. However, the analyst community has revised fourth-quarter earnings estimates higher in the three months – and that’s always a positive sign.\\nNVIDIA has been one of my favorite stocks for many, many years – and it’s up around 380% since I added it to Growth Investor back in May 2019. And while it was stuck at a D-rating in Portfolio Grader recently, its upgrade to a C-rating over the weekend tells me that institutional investor interest in the stock is growing.  We’ll get a better pulse on the company’s fundamentals after its fourth-quarter results and guidance are released, but I do think it’s the better AI bet right now.\\nWith that said, given its C-rating in Portfolio Grader, I would not add new money to the stock just yet. Microsoft, on the other hand, holds a D-rating in Portfolio Grader, making it a “Sell.” Given the company’s mixed earnings and weak stock performance, I don’t expect it to be upgraded to a B-rating (a “Buy”) anytime soon.\\nIf you do have some money to invest, you might want to consider my Growth Investor service. Today, I am adding three exciting new buys in my Growth Investor Monthly Issue for February, as well as revealing my latest Top Stocks lists.\\nFor full details, click here.\\nSincerely,\\nSource: InvestorPlace unless otherwise noted\\n  Louis Navellier\\nP.S.

Analysts forecast that the stock could vault more than 50% higher over the next 12 months.\\nThere's no secret behind this optimism. The demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) continues to surge thanks to the ongoing frenzy to develop artificial intelligence (AI) apps.\\nThis AI boom isn't limited to Nvidia. These three AI stocks could soar even more than Nvidia, according to Wall Street.\\n1. SoundHound AI\\nOnly three analysts surveyed by Refinitiv in August cover SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). However, they're all enthusiastic about the stock. The average 12-month price target for SoundHound AI reflects an upside potential of more than 160%.\\nSuch an upbeat outlook might seem to be suspect considering the roller coaster ride that SoundHound has taken investors on so far this year. But Wall Street appears to be convinced that the company's voice AI technology will attract more business going forward.\\nSoundHound agrees that will be the case. The company reported 42% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 2023. It projects that full-year revenue will jump by close to 50%, based on the midpoint of the guidance range.\\nThe company continues to make further inroads into two industries, especially -- auto manufacturing and restaurants. SoundHound's automotive customers include Honda, Hyundai, and Stellantis. Its restaurant customers include Oracle Food and Beverage, Beef O'Brady's, and White Castle.\\n2. Schrodinger\\nWall Street is also bullish about Schrodinger (NASDAQ: SDGR). The average 12-month price target among the nine analysts surveyed by Refinitiv last month is nearly 90% higher than the stock's current price.\\nThose analysts aren't the only fans of Schrodinger. Cathie Wood's Ark Genomic Revolution ETF owns the stock. So does the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.\\nWhy is Schrodinger so popular? The company is using AI to improve the drug discovery process. Schrodinger's platform can quickly identify the most promising molecules to advance into testing, reducing the cost of developing new drugs.\\nSchrodinger has two programs of its own in clinical testing with more potentially on the way. It's also collaborating with several big drugmakers, including Bristol Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly.\\n3. Symbotic\\nSymbotic (NASDAQ: SYM) ranks as one of the biggest AI winners of 2023 with its shares skyrocketing nearly 160%. It's also highly regarded on Wall Street. The average price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of close to 80%.\\nManaging warehouses has become increasingly complicated with more product types and faster delivery requirements. Symbotic uses AI-powered robotic technology to reinvent how warehouses operate.\\nWalmart ranks as Symbotic's biggest customer by far and owns a stake in the company. Large supermarket chain Albertsons, major wholesale grocery distributor C&S Wholesale Grocers, and Target also use Symbotic's warehouse automation technology.\\nIn July 2023, Symbotic announced a joint venture with SoftBank to go after the $500 billion-plus warehouse-as-a-service market. As part of the deal, the joint venture company (GreenBox Systems) will pay Symbotic around $7.5 billion over a six-year period to use its technology platform.\\nFollow Wall Street's lead?\\nShould you follow Wall Street's lead and buy these three AI stocks? Maybe, maybe not.\\nRisk-averse investors will probably be better off looking elsewhere. None of these three companies are profitable at this point. Schrodinger, in particular, faces significant risks that the drugs it discovers won't pan out.\\nHowever, aggressive investors could like all three of these stocks. There's no guarantee that they'll deliver the kinds of returns that analysts envision. But they all have great AI technology and are targeting promising markets. SoundHound AI, Schrodinger, and Symbotic just might outperform Nvidia going forward.\\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia\\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The technology, which had been relatively dormant in prior years, is set to become one of the most exciting and disruptive technologies of the 21st century. This has led to the rise of AI stock opportunities.\\nArtificial intelligence has the potential to transform various industries, including health care, manufacturing, finance, education, and more. Most recent breakthroughs have been achieved in “generative AI,” which leverages large language models to take in various inputs, such as text or images, to create diverse forms of content for users.\\nAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the global AI market size was valued at $136.55 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. Such a large market with a rapid growth rate creates ample opportunity for public equity investors to benefit from. However, it is always best for investors to be patient and await cheaper valuations before making an investment.\\nThere was quite a bit of market volatility leading up to last week’s decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates, pushing the valuations of some stocks lower. Thus, here is a list of three AI stock opportunities for you to consider.\\nInternational Business Machines (IBM)\\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\\nFounded more than a century ago, IBM (NYSE: IBM) has made itself into a global technology behemoth, offering a wide range of services and solutions, including cloud infrastructure, technology consulting, and financial services.\\nThe technology firm is at the forefront of industrial research efforts, primarily through IBM Research, which has allowed IBM to innovate in novel fields, despite being an older company. In particular, IBM has begun offering AI solutions and services through its Watson platform. Started as a project in 2010 and released earlier in 2023, Watson is an AI system that can understand natural language, analyze large amounts of data, and generate insights and recommendations for users. Enterprises will be able to use the AI platform not only to analyze data but also to build language models. This makes it one of those AI stock opportunities.\\nDespite having dedicated research to advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning, IBM’s shares have not experienced any rally from the ‘AI craze.’ Sluggish top-line growth could be a factor. IBM only grew revenue in 2022 and 2021 by 5% and 4%, respectively, and years prior had even seen revenue compression. In 2022, IBM made 41% of its revenue from its software division, which includes IBM’s open-source hybrid cloud platform that allows users to make software applications from anywhere. 31% of revenues were attributable to IBM’s consulting business. As Watson starts to build traction amongst IBM customers, growth could lift for both software and consulting segments, breathing life into IBM’s sluggish business growth. These prospects, along with IBM’s steady dividend yield, should make this stock attractive for buyers.\\nC3.ai (AI)\\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\\nAfter a number of business changes, C3.ai (NYSE:AI) has committed to developing and deploying AI enterprise software; hence ‘ai’ is attached to its core name. Operating both domestically and internationally, C3.ai provides an application development and runtime environment, dubbed the ‘C3 AI Platform’, to provide enterprises with the tools to develop and deploy their own AI applications. The company also provides turnkey AI application solutions to serve clients in a variety of industries.\\nDespite a lot of hype around artificial intelligence and C3’s shares soaring as a result, the enterprise software company’s financials have been increasingly scrutinized by equity investors. C3.ai has reported strong revenue growth over the past three years, yet profitability and margins have wavered.\\nAs an example, in fiscal year 2021, C3.ai was able to increase its diluted earnings per share from a loss of -$1.94 to -$0.83, but in its most recent fiscal year 2023 report, C3.ai reported a larger EPS loss of -$2.45. Furthermore, many of the opportunities in the company’s customer pipeline are still in the pilot stage. These worrying details compounded to a broader selloff of C3.ai shares in mid-June, and C3.ai shares are still trading below their YTD peak. Investors intrigued by C3.ai’s compelling business turnaround and looking to bet on the capabilities of the C3 AI platform should take this as an opportunity.\\nSAP SE (SAP)\\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP) specializes in developing a variety of enterprise software products. The company’s core enterprise resource planning cloud product includes both SAP S/4HANA and SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud tools. The former includes software tools for project management, risk, procurement, manufacturing, and supply chain applications. At the same time, the latter help customers optimize manufacturing performance by integrating production execution, visibility, and analysis. These tools create a platform with the ability to serve customers in a multitude of industries.\\nThough already investing in machine learning and AI tools in its myriad of applications, SAP began an earnest series of investments into generative AI in 2023. A few weeks ago, the company announced investments in a handful of generative AI start-ups, including Anthropic, Cohere, and Aleph Alpha. These investments build on the more than $1 billion in commitments the company has already made over the past few years. The supply chain software company clearly foresees generative AI will be instrumental in its products. A few weeks ago, SAP also announced a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to embed ChatGPT into its products. All in all, it’s one of those AI stock opportunities you can’t miss.\\nOn July 20th, SAP announced Q2’2023 earnings but missed Wall Street’s revenue and profit estimates. Despite this, the company’s cloud business experienced significant growth. SAP S/4HANA’s growth and the company’s decisive investments in generative AI should put this stock on many investors’ watch lists. SAP shares are still trading below this year’s peak at nearly $145; now could be a buying opportunity.\\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

With the surge, Nvidia’s market cap is approaching the elite $1 trillion mark. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has captured the imagination of the world following the launch of the viral ChatGPT chatbot late last year. Technology companies and developers have been scrambling to deploy generative AI into their applications and investors are counting on this to drive a windfall of sorts for Nvidia, whose server chips remain the go-to products for AI workloads. So is Nvidia’s stock surge warranted and is the stock a buy at current levels of around $380 per share? We don’t think so. Below, we take a look at Nvidia’s role in the AI space and why we believe the stock is overvalued.\\nArtificial intelligence workloads require a considerable amount of computing capacity, shifting the power balance away from central processing units made by the likes of Intel to Graphics processors, a market which Nvidia dominates. For perspective, advanced AI computers today have as many as eight GPUs but just one or two CPUs and this trend is only likely to scale through the computing industry as more applications use generative AI capabilities. Nvidia has a suite of chips tailor made for AI.  For example, the company’s H100 GPU offers high-end computing capabilities focused on deep learning, machine learning, and other AI tasks and is optimized for data center environments. The Grace Hopper processors are custom-designed CPU chips developed by Nvidia to work in conjunction with GPUs for AI workloads. The company has been looking to develop an ecosystem of sorts around its AI tools, with its own programming languages, and software, which are helping the company to better lock in customers. Nvidia appears to be preparing well on the production front to handle the surging demand, indicating that it had procured substantially larger commitments from its suppliers. The strong demand and supply planning are being reflected in the company’s Q2 guidance, with revenue projected at $11 billion at the mid-point (translating into 60% year-over-year growth), compared to the Wall Street consensus of just $7.2 billion in sales.\\nWhile we have raised our price estimate for Nvidia from around $178 per share to about $256 per share, to account for the stronger outlook for the data center business, we think the stock looks overvalued. At the current market price of about $380 per share, Nvidia stock trades at about 30x forward revenue and about 80x forward earnings. This compares to the broader semiconductor industry average price-to-sales multiple of about 4.5x. Even Tesla stock didn’t trade at P/S multiples of these levels at its peak in 2020-2021.  Nvidia’s high multiples are not supported by the company’s potential growth rates and the possible risks that Nvidia faces in the space. Consensus estimates for 2025 point to just about 25% revenue growth. While these numbers might be conservative, we don’t believe even slightly better growth rates will support a multiple this high. Although Nvidia remains in pole position on the market for AI chips, competition in the AI market could mount, with traditional chipmakers such as Intel and AMD potentially inventing to catch up in this space given the high stakes. Moreover, big tech players such as Google are also doubling down on AI and machine learning-related silicon. For example, Google’s Tensor Processing Units are specialized integrated circuits focused on machine learning.

Nvidia's blockbuster first-quarter results and forward guidance have spurred huge gains for its share price and helped trigger an upswing in bullish momentum across the broader market, but Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes that the biggest AI investing opportunity actually lies in software right now.\\nIn a May 31 interview with Bloomberg TV, Wood said that here company was looking beyond semiconductor stocks when it comes to capitalizing on revolutionary AI trends. Based on statements in the interview and comments made earlier in the week, Ark's CEO believes that valuations for top AI chip stocks have gotten stretched to unfavorable levels.\\nInstead, Wood believes that top software-as-a-service companies with significant AI components present the best buying opportunities right now -- and the influential growth investors singled out four stocks in particular that could see powerful benefits.\\nCathie Wood isn't dazzled by Nvidia stock right now\\nWood's Ark Innovation ETF actually reduced its holdings in Nvidia at the beginning of this year. While the semiconductor company's fantastic Q1 earnings results and new growth outlook in AI have undoubtedly improved its valuation picture, the Ark CEO thinks the chip leader's valuation has gotten ahead of what the business's fundamentals and growth outlook can justify right now.\\nAs Wood noted in the Bloomberg TV interview, the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and prone to boom-bust trends. There are risks that come with buying into huge rallies even when there are real, underlying catalysts worth being excited about.\\nWith Nvidia trading at record highs, the famously growth-oriented Wood may be right to look to other companies that can benefit from AI trends. Rather than investing in the hardware that will power new AI applications, Wood sees more promise in investing in the software that will be made possible by powerful processors.\\nThis is Wood's favorite AI stock\\nAcross its various exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stands as Ark's biggest bet in the AI space. But while the electric-vehicle (EV) company still generates the large majority of its revenue from vehicle sales, Wood sees self-driving software as being the driving component of its long-term growth story.\\nThrough advances in autonomous vehicle technologies, Tesla will have the opportunity to roll out robotaxi services. Ark's CEO expects that this new business opportunity will power huge sales and earnings momentum for the EV leader.\\nRemarkably, Wood believes that Tesla stock will reach a price of $2,000 per share in 2027. With the stock currently trading at roughly $204 per share, her target implies potential upside of roughly 880%. The EV stock still trades down roughly 50% from its lifetime high, but Ark is betting that the foundations for a massive rally are in place.\\nArk is making other big bets on AI software\\nArk's ETFs are heavily focused on growth stocks in the technology and fintech industries, and performance for many of the core holdings in its funds will be shaped by the progression of the artificial-intelligence revolution. In particular, Wood recently said she believes three beaten-down software stocks will be huge beneficiaries of the AI trend.\\nUiPath is a provider of automation and low-code application development tools that could benefit from new AI-focused features.\\nTwilio is already providing chatbot tools and other machine-learning powered communication and customer-management tools, and artificial intelligence could bolster the value of its offerings.\\nTeladoc is a provider of online health services that could benefit from advances for AI-driven diagnostic capabilities.\\nAs of this writing, UiPath, Twilio, and Teladoc's stock prices are down 79%, 84%, and 92% from their respective peaks.\\nShould you buy Wood's top AI picks?\\nInvestors should weigh their own personal risk tolerance and portfolio goals before making big stock purchases based on Wood's picks. While Tesla, UiPath, Twilio, and Teladoc all trade at significant discounts compared to their previous highs and potentially stand to see strong tailwinds from AI, they might not be a great fit for every investor and could also face some disruptive impacts from the tech trend.\\nIf your approach to investing is in line with the high-risk, high-reward style favored by Wood and Ark, building positions in some or all of these stocks could make sense for your portfolio. Just keep in mind that it's a good idea to do some thorough research before going all in on any of these AI software plays.\\nFind out why Tesla is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\\nOur analyst team has spent more than a decade beating the market.

However, at least in the business-news media, most of the attention has been narrowly focused on several areas. Specifically, those media outlets have focused on the ways in which AI will affect Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). And, of course, the phenomenon of ChatGPT, which appears to have largely been taken over by Microsoft. Finally, a great deal of ink has been spilled about Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) status as a supplier of chips used to facilitate AI.\\nIn the second half of the year, I believe that these media outlets will focus on other AI industry news. Specifically, AI’s influence on digital content, marketing, chip makers, and healthcare will gain more attention in late 2023. This change will boost many stocks in each of these sectors.\\nDigital Content and Digital Marketing\\nSource: mama_mia / Shutterstock.com\\nSnap’s (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat and Meta (NASDAQ:META), the owner of Facebook and Instagram, are both extensively utilizing AI. Snapchat enhances its content, while Meta focuses on improving ads using the same technology.\\nSnap has launched an AI-powered chatbot called “My AI.” Similar to ChatGPT, MyAI, unlike ChatGPT provides “recommendations for restaurants and other activities.” Additionally, this platform provides ideas for “augmented reality lenses.” Users appear to enjoy chatting with MyAI. That’s because user numbers are impressive, with two million messages sent via MyAI as of April 19. Additionally, earlier this month, Snap began launching ads that will be posted in tandem with the chatbot.\\nMeanwhile, Meta has launched AI Sandbox. This enables ads to be more customized to individual users. It also designs ad backgrounds more easily and enables marketers to utilize graphics in different formats.\\nThese changes will increase the appeal of digital content and accelerate the shift of ad dollars to the digital realm.\\nConsequently, Meta, Snap, and other companies that obtain a large percentage of their revenue from digital ads, such as Alphabet and IAC (NASDAQ:IAC), should get a big boost.\\nOther Chipmakers Will Enter the Limelight\\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\\nSo far, Nvidia has gotten the lion’s share of the “AI love” from the financial media and investors. But many other chipmakers are going to get a lift from the AI industry.\\nFor example, Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) Gaudi2 chips have shown the ability to train chatbots and be competitive with Nvidia when it comes to the pace of training AI systems. Meanwhile, it appears that the proliferation of AI is also going to greatly increase the demand for Micron’s (NASDAQ:MU) memory chips. Also, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) recently introduced its “Jericho3-AI chip.” The company claims this chip has “the industry’s highest performance fabric for artificial intelligence networks.”\\nFinally, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) has developed “a line of AI microcontrollers that run AI commands hundreds of times faster and with lower energy than other products,” according to the company.\\nHealthcare AI Stocks Will Become a Much Bigger Deal\\nSource: Supavadee butradee / Shutterstock.com\\nIn a previous column, I noted that a doctor had stated that AI “can be a key means of enabling healthcare to become more personalized and making diagnoses earlier.”\\nAI-focused healthcare firms are expected to receive increased attention for this reason. I expect much of this attention to come in the latter half of the year, given the sector’s significant spending and AI’s potential to enhance it. Schrodinger’s (NASDAQ:SDGR) stock price surged 39% over the past three months, and 20% over the past five days, on news that it is utilizing AI for faster drug discovery. I expect more companies to follow suit.\\nAs of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of SDGR and INTC.

The privately held artificial intelligence (AI) outfit fired its CEO and co-founder Sam Altman leading several top people at the firm to quit in protest. Hundreds of employees demanded the board of directors resign. \\nFinancial backer Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was also caught flatfooted. Having invested billions into the company and integrated ChatGPT into all aspects of its business, the tech giant is the investor with the most to lose. CEO Satya Nadella immediately hired Altman and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, promising to provide them “with the resources needed for their success.”\\nOpenAI approached rival Anthropic about a merger. Others are trying to lure away employees with large financial incentives. For awhile it seemed as if the future of OpenAI’s survival was in doubt. But Altman was reinstalled as CEO and the board that ousted him is leaving.\\nDespite the tumult, AI still represents fantastic opportunities for investors to profit. What follows are three AI stocks to buy that can turn patient investors into millionaires.\\nSalesforce (CRM)\\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) got its start as a software leader for customer relationship management (CRM). Annual revenue has grown at a compounded annual rate of 26% for at least the past decade, rising from less than $3 billion to over $31 billion today. Now AI is poised to accelerate its growth for the next 10 years.\\nChairman and CEO Marc Benioff told analysts Saleforce is “transforming from being not only the number one CRM, but to the number one AI CRM.” AI is the force behind Salesforce’s current performance. Quarterly revenue jumped 11% to $8.6 billion while adjusted operating margins widened to 31.6% from 19.9%. Benioff says AI pushed the company into being the world’s third-largest enterprise software company by revenue.\\nNot only is Salesforce driving its own results higher, but it helping others to grow. Through a $500 million generative AI fund, Salesforce is financing AI businesses like Anthropic, Cohere, and Hugging Face. In-house and in business, Salesforce is a leading AI entrepreneur itself. It was also the one trying to lure away OpenAI employees with promises of financial rewards.\\nThe stock is not cheap, but there is no stopping its growth now. Buying Salesforce stock will turn investors with a sufficient investment horizon into millionaires.\\nBaidu (BIDU)\\nChinese search engine Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has also transformed itself into something new. It recently released its version of ChatGPT called Ernie Bot and detailed its latest fourth-generation generative AI model. Baidu maintains it is every bit as powerful in its performance as OpenAI’s chatbot. In just-reported earnings, CFO Rong Luo promised the tech stock will continue prioritizing AI investments. “We will do so with an unrelenting focus on efficiency and strategic resource allocation,” he said.\\nCo-founder and CEO Robin Li said AI will “set the stage for sustained multi-year revenue and profit expansion within” Baidu’s Ernie ecosystem. Like Salesforce, Baidu is using AI to transform itself and other businesses.\\nChina, of course, is a massive market to target. It is also largely closed off to most outside investors in areas where Beijing believes it is critical to Chinese superiority. As the country’s premiere AI stock, Baidu will have virtually unfettered opportunity to expand. \\nBaidu’s stock is very cheap. It trades at 10 times earnings estimates and a bargain-basement 11x free cash flow (FCF). Minting millionaires will be the search giant’s next most important accomplishment in the coming years.\\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\\nSource: Shutterstock\\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) might not be a household name just yet, but there’s a better-than-even chance Supermicro as it is called will eventually become one. A semiconductor equipment manufacturer, it builds servers, storage solutions, switch systems, and more. Supermicro was successful on its own, but its close partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) helped supercharge the equipment maker’s performance.\\nPresident and CEO Charles Liang says it is by working with Nvidia that its customers can deploy generative AI quickly within their operations. By partnering with NVIDIA to design the most advanced systems for AI training and high-performance computing applications,” Liang said “Our building block architecture enables us to be first to market with the latest technology, allowing customers to deploy generative AI faster than ever before.”\\nAnnual revenue now exceeds $7 billion from $1.1 billion 10 years ago, a 20% CAGR. Expect that to increase exponentially. A new facility in Malaysia that will open next year will double Supermicro’s manufacturing capacity. The market sees the potential. Shares more than tripled in 2023. Yet at 15 times earnings estimates, the AI stock shows it still has the potential to create new millionaires amongst investors willing to make a bet on its future.\\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

That “need to know” certainly extends to artificial intelligence — including the AI-powered ChatGPT. And when the excitement over ChatGPT spooled up months ago — and folks were fascinated by its ability to write a children’s book in 72 hours — I was more intrigued by how it could make that happen.\\nAnd, as the head of an investing venture like TradeSmith, the very real moneymaking opportunities AI creates for our customers. That’s why, back on March 2, I told you here about chipmaker Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), when its shares were trading at about $224. Nvidia makes the A100, a $10,000 chip that’s helping power the “AI arms race.” The company also sells the DGX A100, which is eight A100 GPUs working together.\\nI shared this because this special technology put Nvidia in a lead position in the AI revolution. Indeed, analysts at Citigroup are currently forecasting that ChatGPT growth alone could funnel an additional $3 billion to $11 billion in revenue into Nvidia’s coffers from the start of 2023 to the start of 2024. Since our report to you here, Nvidia’s shares have rocketed to about $416 each — an 85% gain in five short months.\\nI’m not just sharing that as a kind of “victory lap” — because we all know that investing is very much a “what comes next” financial challenge. So I’m going to do just that. I’m going to talk a bit about what comes next for Nvidia. And what our predictive tools are saying about what comes next for its share price.\\nThe Next-Generation AI Chip\\nAs of June, ChatGPT had 100 million users and over 1.6 billion visits to its websites – with folks asking it for cookie recipes, for help with emails, with respite from writer’s block, and even as a second set of eyes for scouring lines of code for software bugs. But the problem is, the more folks turn to ChatGPT, the more memory and bandwidth it needs.\\nOn the site Down for Everyone or Just Me, which lets people know if a website is not working for that specific person or if there are broader issues, it just recently detected an outage for 41 minutes on August 10.\\nWith Nvidia’s brand-new GH200 (Grace CUP and Hopper GPU) and a dual GH200 system, Nvidia offers a solution. I won’t bog you down with a technical-specs discussion (though, I confess, I’m personally fascinated). But I will share more “what comes next” insight. This newest innovation from Nvidia — which we should expect to see in the middle of next year — will add 70% in memory capacity and 50% in bandwidth to accommodate the stampede of new users. Nvidia believes this can help companies cut costs while also increasing efficiency — a double win.\\nIn short, while Nvidia has grabbed an early AI lead, it’s not standing pat. Historically, that “we’re never satisfied” mindset has been part and parcel of the company’s corporate culture. And it certainly won’t stand pat in AI — quite likely the greatest growth window of our generation. Nvidia’s leadership team wants to build a lead so big that its rivals will never catch up.\\nWe don’t have to wait for that to happen. We can look at Nvidia through the lens of long-term investing and short-term investing to increase our moneymaking potential today.\\nNvidia Under The TradeSmith Investing Microscope\\nOur Health Indicator was developed so that you could know the “investable state” of a company in an instant — whether it’s something to buy, hold with caution, or just flat-out avoid. Nvidia is in our Green Zone as of this writing, which can be thought of as the green “Go” light on a traffic signal — it means this company is considered a “buy.” We can also look at its Business Quality Score for additional confirmation of its long-term outlook. Our Business Quality Score rates every company based on a composite of four broad quality metrics:\\nGrowth: This metric measures changes in a company’s finances such as sales, profit, return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA), and cash flow over the past five years.\\nProfitability: This metric measures a company’s current level of profitability relative to its assets, sales, and shareholder equity.\\nSafety: This metric measures a company’s financial strength (debt burden, credit risk, etc.) and its stock’s historical volatility versus the overall market.\\nPayout: This metric measures how much of what a company earns benefits shareholders via dividends, net share buybacks, and debt repayment.\\nOur algorithms first calculate the current quality score for each stock compared to its history and all other stocks in our database. They then average those scores for each stock and rate the stock on a quality scale from 0 (lowest quality) to 100 (highest quality). Nvidia has a stellar score of 91 — meaning it gallops along with other class-of-the-field companies. But if you’ve found yourself getting caught in the trap of “buying at the wrong time” for long-term positions, don’t worry.\\nThere’s something that can help — our predictive AI software we’ve code-named An-E. This breakthrough A.I. stock forecasting system can sort through millions of data points in real time, making hyper-accurate stock price predictions, alerting us as to which stocks are poised to soar in the weeks ahead. An-E has a bullish outlook on Nvidia stock, predicting the price will climb 5% by September 11.\\nThat’s 5% — over the next month. Along with the forward-looking picture I’ve painted, this serves as additional “what comes next” insight for Nvidia’s shares.\\nBottom line: There’s been a lot of money made by owning Nvidia this year, but we aren’t looking backward. The company continues to bulk up its “AI Muscle,” with a leadership market position, superior technology, a commitment to keep building, and an addressable market that’s growing at hypersonic speeds. Adding to that “intelligence” is the fact that our predictive analytics say that Nvidia is in a healthy and investable state with a stellar Business Quality Score. The most bullish analysts have a $1,000 price target on Nvidia over the next 12 months — 140% higher than where it’s trading right now. The short-term outlook is also favorable, with the stock price expected to climb more than 5% over the next month.\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.', 'stock_symbol': 'NVDA'}\n",

In this Backstage Pass clip from \"The AI/ML Show\" recorded on Jan. 12, Motley Fool contributor Trevor Jennewine talks about how these developments could shake up the AI industry in 2022.\\n{% sfr %}\\nTrevor Jennewine: At Tesla\\'s AI Day in 2021, they introduced the D1 chip and this will power its Dojo supercomputer. I don\\'t want to get too technical, but each chip offers 362 teraflops of compute performance. That\\'s 362 trillion floating point operations per second. Basically, think of that as 362 trillion calculations each second, so very powerful and Tesla is going to organize those chips, 25 chips per training tile. It\\'s going to take 12 tiles, put them in a cabinet, and it\\'s going to connect 10 server cabinets. You\\'re going to end up with a system that has a 120 training tiles each with 25 of those chips, which brings the compute power of Dojo to over one exa-flop. That is one quintillion floating point operations per second, that\\'s one followed by 18 zeros, so very powerful.\\nThe system is supposed to be operational sometime this year, and if it works out like they presented it at their AI Day, it should theoretically make Dojo the world\\'s most powerful AI training machine. And then on the inference side, this is the in-car supercomputer. I mentioned that Tesla replaced Nvidia\\'s chips with its own custom chips when it released autopilot hardware 3.0. Elon Musk called it the best chip in the world. He says, makes a lot of bold statements so take that with a grain of salt. But analysts took a look at it, the Nikkei Asia review.

All over the world, companies are investing in AI capabilities that will improve productivity and customer experiences. How can investors benefit from the AI trend? Besides picks and shovel plays, companies using AI to empower users are AI stocks to buy and hold.\\nCurrently, the apparent beneficiary of AI is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The semiconductor giant has a near monopoly in AI chips. Its best-in-class GPUs are used for training large language models. As expected, its revenues have soared, with even the latest earnings guidance beating Wall Street consensus by a considerable margin.\\nApart from Nvidia, there are other cheaper players. For instance, semiconductor companies Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Marvel Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) have thriving AI businesses. At the same time, other companies are leveraging the technology to offer customers more productive and automated applications.\\nThe following companies are AI stocks to buy and hold. Technically, they are less extended than AI bellwether Nvidia. Also, the valuation is much more reasonable, offering downside protection in an economic slowdown.\\nBroadcom (AVGO)\\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\\nOn September 1, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) had a 5% pullback after reporting in-line third-quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings. The selloff presents a buying opportunity in one of the advantaged AI stocks to buy and hold.\\nAs the results highlighted, revenues grew 5% year-over-year as strength in the networking for the generative AI segment accelerated. Broadcom is a major supplier to hyperscalers, providing custom AI compute engines. It is helping these companies build out their AI clusters in their data centers.\\nIn the quarter, their generative AI business produced more than $1 billion in revenue. In contrast, the other semiconductor business was flat. The AI segment now represents over 11% of total revenue and accounted for all the growth in the infrastructure business in the quarter.\\nThe prospects for growth are even stronger heading into the fourth quarter. In the earnings call, CEO Hock Tan stated, “…we expect our networking revenue to accelerate in excess of 20% year-on-year. And this has been driven by the strength obviously in generative AI where we forecast to grow about 50% sequentially.”\\nIndeed, over the next year, generative AI demand will drive Broadcom’s revenue growth. That’s why analysts remain bullish on the stock despite the selloff. Several analysts raised their price targets, pointing out the growth from AI opportunities.\\nMoreover, the undemanding valuation makes it one of the AI stocks to buy and hold. AVGO stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings of 20, offering a favorable risk-reward ratio.\\nSalesforce (CRM)\\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\\nAlthough it’s not a pick and shovels play, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is leveraging AI to empower its customers. In other words, the company is integrating AI technology into its applications to improve productivity. As these advantages appear, Salesforce can charge more for its products, accelerating revenue growth.\\nThe company is leading the AI charge, as CEO Marc Benioff highlighted in the second quarter earnings release. “As the #1 AI CRM, with industry-leading clouds, Einstein, Data Cloud, MuleSoft, Slack, and Tableau, all integrated on one trusted, unified platform, we’re leading our customers into the new AI era.”\\nSalespeople use the company’s cloud software to originate prospects, track customer communications, and close deals. By integrating AI, which can produce insights from enterprise data, salespeople can be more productive. Its AI-powered CRM can auto-generate sales tasks, personalized content for customers, and customer insights.\\nIn terms of fundamentals, Salesforce is a turnaround story getting back on track. The days of profligate spending are long gone, and the company is focused on profitability. Since last year, it has made significant progress. For example, in the second quarter, GAAP operating margins were 17.2% compared to 2.5% in the previous year’s quarter.\\nAlso, the company raised guidance expecting 11% YOY revenue growth and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS of $8.04 – $8.06 for FY2023. Due to the positive outlook, analysts think it’s one of the top AI stocks to buy and hold. After earnings, J.P. Morgan’s Mark Murphy raised his price target to $240 from $230, citing improving margins and free cash flow.\\nAdobe (ADBE)\\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\\nLike Salesforce, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is another company empowering its users by integrating AI into its applications. Initially, there were fears that AI would disrupt Adobe’s design software. But the company has responded decisively, making it one of the top AI stocks to buy and hold.\\nIn March, the company launched Firefly, its range of creative Generative AI models trained on unique data sets. The service enables customers to use word prompts to generate images, audio, videos, and vectors. Firefly simplifies the content creation process and enhances the speed of creatives.\\nFirefly is now integrated into Adobe Express, making editing PDFs, touching up images, and creating immersive videos more straightforward and faster. It is already gaining traction and is available in over 100 languages. Since launching in March, users have generated over one billion images.\\nBank of America analyst Brad Sill recently upgraded the stock to “buy.” Also, he raised the price target to $630 from $575. In the note, he opined that Adobe was a leader that would continue gaining share in the creative software category.\\nAdditionally, he noted that Adobe would have incremental growth from AI in the coming year. With Firefly integrated into Adobe’s key products – Photoshop, Express, and Illustrator – the company is set for more growth.\\nAnd the growth comes at a reasonable valuation. Adobe is a profit machine with gross profit margins above 85% and free cash flow margins above 30%. Considering the best-in-class profitability and AI-powered growth, it should be one of the AI stocks to buy and hold for long-term gains.\\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A similar (although less exuberant) phenomenon appears to be underway now. The difference this time is that the technology in question is artificial intelligence (AI).\\nSeveral tech giants are especially on a roll. Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have jumped nearly 20% so far in 2023. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stands out as one of the biggest winners of all, with a year-to-date gain of over 85%.\\nBut which of these will be the better AI stock over the long run? Here's how Amazon and Nvidia stack up against each other.\\nThe case for Amazon\\nAmazon's most visible AI product is its Alexa virtual assistant. As widely used as Alexa is, though, it's not the most significant AI opportunity for Amazon. That distinction belongs to the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit.\\nAWS ranks as the largest cloud services provider in the world, with a market share of 33%, according to technology services company AAG. It's a key growth driver and Amazon's most profitable business.\\nOrganizations that want to build AI applications in the cloud already have plenty of tools at their disposal with AWS. AI services offered include building chatbots, speech recognition, text-to-speech, image and video analysis, language translation, and a lot more.\\nAmazon is poised for tremendous growth over the next decade and beyond, thanks in large part to AWS' AI opportunity. But AI isn't the only business that could provide a major catalyst for the stock. Other major potential growth drivers for Amazon include connected TV and healthcare.\\nThe case for Nvidia\\nNvidia rose to success because its graphics processing units (GPUs) were the gold standard for powering gaming apps. Gaming remains a huge moneymaker for the company -- and a significant growth opportunity as well.\\nHowever, Nvidia's future fortunes are linked to AI more than anything else. The same attributes that made the company's GPUs so great for gaming also make them ideal for AI apps.\\nMany of the biggest names in AI have teamed up with Nvidia. Amazon's AWS and Nvidia have been partners for over 10 years and announced a new generative AI collaboration last month. Alphabet is integrating Nvidia's GPUs with its Google Cloud Vertex AI platform. Microsoft is making Nvidia's DGX Cloud AI supercomputer available to customers on its Azure cloud platform.\\nNvidia doesn't just have powerful chips and hardware, though. It offers a full-blown AI platform including its supercomputer, software, AI models, and services. The company's AI solutions feature data analytics, generative AI, speech AI, self-driving car technology, and more.\\nOne of the most intriguing AI innovations from Nvidia is its new cuLitho software library. This AI software helps chipmakers significantly speed up their manufacturing process. In a real sense, AI could help make AI better with cuLitho.\\nBetter AI stock?\\nBoth Amazon and Nvidia should have tremendous growth potential amid the AI boom. However, we haven't discussed two important factors yet: competition and valuation.\\nAmazon's AWS unit faces increasingly tough competition from other cloud services providers, notably including Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. It's possible (and arguably probable) that these two main rivals will gain market share at AWS' expense.\\nLikewise, Nvidia has competition in the AI arena. In particular, AMD is betting big on AI. For now, though, Nvidia appears to have a clear advantage.\\nBoth Amazon and Nvidia stocks trade at lofty earnings multiples. However, Amazon is taking steps to increase its profits, which should lead to stronger earnings growth over the next few years. Meanwhile, some investors are worried that Nvidia's share price has risen too much, too quickly.\\nI like and own both of these stocks. Amazon is one of my favorite stocks to buy right now. My view, though, is that Nvidia is in a better position than Amazon to profit in more ways from the rise of AI. Because of this, I see it as the better AI stock over the long term.\\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia\\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) isn\\'t one of them.\\nBut Tesla CEO Elon Musk thinks that his company could leapfrog past trillion-dollar market cap members Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. Musk stated during Tesla\\'s third-quarterearnings callthat artificial intelligence (AI) could \"make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far.\" Here\\'s how he thinks it could happen.\\nFully autonomous cars\\nUnsurprisingly, Musk mentioned fully autonomous cars as the first way that AI could turbocharge Tesla\\'s growth. He thinks the \"economics of the system [with fully autonomous vehicles] are just insanely positive.\"\\nMusk noted that passenger vehicles are currently only used around 10 to 12 hours per week on average. There are also other costs associated with parking, insurance, and maintenance. People spend a lot of money for such low utilization.\\nWith fully autonomous cars, though, Musk speculated that utilization rates could increase by 5x. He said if that happens, then Tesla will be \"a hardware company with software margins.\"\\nThe multibillionaire proclaimed that he\\'s \"very excited about our progress with autonomy.\" He stated that Tesla\\'s FSD (fully self-driving) beta vehicles have already driven over 500 million miles and counting. Musk believes that very few people \"understand the profundity of the Tesla AI system.\" He added: \"It\\'s basically baby AGI [artificial general intelligence]. It has to understand reality in order to drive, baby AGI.\"\\nFully autonomous robots\\nFully self-driving cars are only part of the equation, though. Musk said in Tesla\\'s Q3 call, \"If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it\\'s not clear what the limit is.\"\\nAgain, Musk likes the economics of autonomous robots. He explained, \"[I]f you no longer have a constraint on people, effectively, you\\'ve got a humanoid robot that can do as much as you\\'d like. Your economy is wisely infinite or infinite for all intents and purposes.\"\\nMusk told analysts on the Q3 call that the same AI software behind Tesla\\'s fully autonomous cars will power its Optimus humanoid robots. He predicted that Optimus will be able \"to learn how to do things simply by looking.\" Musk also believes that \"robots will manufacture the robots\" in the future.\\nOther companies, including privately held Boston Dynamics, are developing humanoid robots as well. However, Musk doesn\\'t appear to be worried about the competition. He said, \"I don\\'t think anyone is going to do it better than Tesla by a long shot.\"\\nWill Musk be proven right?\\nMusk acknowledged that he\\'s \"been overly optimistic\" in the past about how quickly Tesla will deliver fully autonomous cars. Is he being unrealistically optimistic in this case? Maybe.\\nDespite being directly asked by analysts during the Q3 call, Musk wouldn\\'t provide any timing about when Tesla plans to launch a robotaxi service. The company is already behind General Motors\\' Cruise and Alphabet\\'s Waymo in the robotaxi market. There\\'s a pretty good argument to be made that GM is actually a better stock to play the robotaxi opportunity than Tesla is.\\nMusk also clearly linked Tesla\\'s AI progress with fully autonomous cars with its efforts to develop a fully autonomous humanoid robot. If the company slips in one area, it will probably slip in both.\\nWe shouldn\\'t overlook the fact that Tesla\\'s path to becoming the most valuable company in the world doesn\\'t depend only on Tesla. AI will also serve as a tremendous tailwind for Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. Tesla could be successful yet still not catch up with these current members of the $1 trillion club.\\nStill, I wouldn\\'t dismiss the possibility that Musk could eventually be proven right. AI really will be, in his own words, a \"massive game changer.\" If Tesla wins in the fully autonomous vehicle and robot markets, it just might one day be the biggest company on the planet.\\nFind out why Tesla is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\\nOur analyst team has spent more than a decade beating the market.

That case tests whether a U.S. law that protects technology platforms from legal responsibility for content posted online by their users also applies when companies use algorithms to target users with recommendations.\\nWhat the court decides about those issues is relevant beyond social media platforms. Its ruling could influence the emerging debate over whether companies that develop generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT from OpenAI, a company in which Microsoft Corp MSFT.O is a major investor, or Bard from Alphabet\\'s Google should be protected from legal claims like defamation or privacy violations, according to technology and legal experts.\\nThat is because algorithms that power generative AI tools like ChatGPT and its successor GPT-4 operate in a somewhat similar way as those that suggest videos to YouTube users, the experts added.\\n\"The debate is really about whether the organization of information available online through recommendation engines is so significant to shaping the content as to become liable,\" said Cameron Kerry, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington and an expert on AI. \"You have the same kinds of issues with respect to a chatbot.\"\\nRepresentatives for OpenAI and Google did not respond to requests for comment.\\nDuring arguments in February, Supreme Court justices expressed uncertainty over whether to weaken the protections enshrined in the law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. While the case does not directly relate to generative AI, Justice Neil Gorsuch noted that AI tools that generate \"poetry\" and \"polemics\" likely would not enjoy such legal protections.\\nThe case is only one facet of an emerging conversation about whether Section 230 immunity should apply to AI models trained on troves of existing online data but capable of producing original works.\\nSection 230 protections generally apply to third-party content from users of a technology platform and not to information a company helped to develop. Courts have not yet weighed in on whether a response from an AI chatbot would be covered.\\n\\'CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR OWN ACTIONS\\'\\nDemocratic Senator Ron Wyden, who helped draft that law while in the House of Representatives, said the liability shield should not apply to generative AI tools because such tools \"create content.\"\\n\"Section 230 is about protecting users and sites for hosting and organizing users\\' speech. It should not protect companies from the consequences of their own actions and products,\" Wyden said in a statement to Reuters.\\nThe technology industry has pushed to preserve Section 230 despite bipartisan opposition to the immunity. They said tools like ChatGPT operate like search engines, directing users to existing content in response to a query.\\n\"AI is not really creating anything. It\\'s taking existing content and putting it in a different fashion or different format,\" said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of NetChoice, a tech industry trade group.\\nSzabo said a weakened Section 230 would present an impossible task for AI developers, threatening to expose them to a flood of litigation that could stifle innovation.\\nSome experts forecast that courts may take a middle ground, examining the context in which the AI model generated a potentially harmful response.\\nIn cases in which the AI model appears to paraphrase existing sources, the shield may still apply. But chatbots like ChatGPT have been known to create fictional responses that appear to have no connection to information found elsewhere online, a situation experts said would likely not be protected.\\nHany Farid, a technologist and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said that it stretches the imagination to argue that AI developers should be immune from lawsuits over models that they \"programmed, trained and deployed.\"\\n\"When companies are held responsible in civil litigation for harms from the products they produce, they produce safer products,\" Farid said. \"And when they\\'re not held liable, they produce less safe products.\"\\nThe case being decided by the Supreme Court involves an appeal by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old college student from California who was fatally shot in a 2015 rampage by Islamist militants in Paris, of a lower court\\'s dismissal of her family\\'s lawsuit against YouTube.\\nThe lawsuit accused Google of providing \"material support\" for terrorism and claimed that YouTube, through the video-sharing platform\\'s algorithms, unlawfully recommended videos by the Islamic State militant group, which claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, to certain users.\\nAs U.S. Supreme Court weighs YouTube\\'s algorithms, \\'litigation minefield\\' looms\\nU.S. Supreme Court raises doubts about suit against Twitter over Istanbul massacre\\nU.S. Supreme Court torn over challenge to internet firms\\' legal shield\\nA family\\'s tragedy leads to U.S. Supreme Court social media showdown\\n(Reporting by Andrew Goudsward; Editing by Will Dunham)\\n((Andrew.Goudsward@thomsonreuters.com;))\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.', 'stock_symbol': 'MSFT'}\n"

The Pros & Cons.', 'date': datetime.datetime(2023, 11, 2, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), 'article': 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\nISO is an acronym for the International Organization for Standardization which is a non-governmental global organization based in Switzerland. It is a governing body responsible for setting commercial and industrial standards. ISO 20022 is a standard for financial messaging that governs the exchange of financial data. \\nNations across the globe have either adopted ISO 20022 standards or are in the process of doing so. The system is being adopted across financial institutions of all stripes. There are also several cryptocurrencies that are ISO 20022 compliant currently. Although ISO 20022 compliance will affect the financial space broadly, this article is focused on the pros and cons as they relate to the cryptocurrency market. \\nPRO: ISO 20022 Compliance Will Raise Demand\\nSource: 0pen / Shutterstock.com\\nOne of the clearest benefits of ISO 20022 compliance is that it will bring those cryptocurrencies that adopt the standard into the fold so to speak. The handful of cryptos that adopt the standard will be plugged into a broader global standard. That list notably excludes leading cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD). \\nInclusion in the mainstream provides benefits that cannot be ignored. ISO 20022 compliance legitimizes those cryptos that adopt it. ISO 20022 affects all financial institutions active in cross-border payments and those active in market infrastructures and corporate-to-bank flows. The vast majority of everything we currently understand as the financial system will be affected. \\nCryptocurrencies have largely operated outside of the traditional financial system during their brief history. By getting on board, so to speak, ISO 20022 compliant cryptos are legitimizing themselves as a ‘real’ part of the financial system. \\nThat will open a lot of hearts and minds to crypto and imbue compliant cryptos with a level of safety non-compliant cryptos will lack. It’s very much analogous to Bitcoin Spot ETFs and the expectation that they will reduce a lot of fear and increase adoption overall. \\nCON: ISO 20022 Compliance is Antithetical\\nSource: eamesBot / Shutterstock\\nA great part of the logic behind the early development of cryptocurrency technology lay in a desire to separate from banks and the larger financial system. Bitcoin is the grandfather of cryptocurrency and has its roots in the financial crash of the late 2000s. \\nConsumers desire peer-to-peer electronic cash systems and transaction functionality. Banks offer that; it’s one of their greatest selling points. However, a reliance on centralized banking and all the negatives that come with it deter many consumers.\\nThat’s why Bitcoin and other cryptos were created: P2P transactional functionality designed to remain separate from central banks, their regulations, and the top-down authority that comes with it. Above all, it’s about self governance and decentralization. \\nThus, the adoption of ISO 20022 standards appears to be a step in the wrong direction when viewed in light of  crypto’s original intent. That greater philosophy is at risk by adopting a global standard despite the standards body’s implied neutrality. \\nPRO: Data Transparency and Increased Analytics\\nSource: metamorworks/Shutterstock\\nOne of the greatest drawbacks of investing in cryptocurrency is that it’s very difficult to make comparisons between given cryptos. It’s very different from the stock market.\\nThere are dozens and dozens of standardized metrics with which one can compare Google (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), for example. It’s very easy to find the price-to-earnings ratio for each and use that objective data to make a subjective determination about both. \\nIt’s much more difficult to engage in similar comparisons of cryptocurrencies. Those that are ISO compliant must report standardized data in order to retain compliance.\\nThat data is a step in the right direction for the analytically minded. It’s going to provide the basis by which a set of crypto metrics can be developed. There are very few such metrics currently. \\nThe larger cryptocurrency market is moving in the same direction as the stock market. That means that we’ll have to rely less on subjective, philosophical arguments for investing in a given crypto and more on objective, analytically rigorous ones. \\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

On Nov. 17, finance minister Jeremy Hunt unveils the government\\'s fiscal plan.\\nSeptember\\'s mini-budget from predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng brought the pound to its knees and forced the Bank of England to intervene to stem a rout in the bond market.\\nHunt has since junked most of that plan, and signalled some 60 billion pounds ($68.70 billion) in tax rises and spending cuts are coming to plug a gaping hole in the public finances.\\nUK markets have recouped most of the maxi-losses from the mini-budget, but the outlook is grim. The economy faces its longest recession in a century, as a cost-of-living crisis bites.\\nLatest inflation and jobs numbers are also on the calendar. Inflation hit a blistering 10.1% in September and there\\'s little reason to expect much of a respite.\\n2/ CRYPTO CHAOS\\nThe crypto world has been thrown into fresh chaos by a meltdown at FTX. On Friday, the major exchange said it would start U.S. bankruptcy proceedings while its Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried resigned.\\nA proposed rescue deal from rival exchange Binance fell through on Wednesday, sending top cryptocurrency bitcoin below $16,000 for the first time since late 2020.\\nCrypto investors are in a state of shock - FTX founder Bankman-Fried was seen by many as the \"poster child\" of the industry. Investors are now waiting to assess the extent of contagion within crypto markets, which have already taken a beating this year as central banks reverse pandemic-era monetary policy. Concerns are also rising about the future of the crypto industry, which faces an uphill task of regaining favour among retail investors.\\n3/ THE IT CROWD\\nThis year\\'s Big Tech equity plunge shows little sign of ending - dogged by squeezed consumer real incomes, recession fears and a valuation rethink due to the soaring interest rates that discount their future revenues to today\\'s price.\\nAfter warnings about online advertising and streaming services littered the third quarter earnings season, mass layoffs are now emerging. Meta PlatformsMETA.O just announced it would cut more than 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce.\\nThat\\'s among the biggest this year and follows job cuts at other tech firms including Elon Musk-owned Twitter, Microsoft, MSFT.O and Snap SNAP.O. Big banks too are starting to pare back staffing levels.\\nMarkets are watching closely to see if others follow - and try to gauge whether this is merely retrenchment from over-exuberant, pandemic-distorted staffing levels or the thin end of the wedge that deepens any oncoming recession. Central banks will be watching like hawks too.\\n4/ BIG SPENDER\\nWednesday\\'s U.S. October retail sales should provide markets with a sense of how consumers are faring ahead of the key holiday shopping season.\\nAnd remember the Federal Reserve is intent on hiking interest rates to contain hot inflation, even if that means a squeeze on consumption in the process.\\nSeptember data showed a measure of underlying retail sales rising thanks to strong wage gains and savings, even as the broader number came in flat. Analysts polled by Reuters expect a 0.8% increase for October.\\nThe good-news-is-bad news crowd would likely see a strong number as evidence that the Fed has more work to do in cooling the economy. That outlook is unlikely to bring joy to markets battered by expectations of more monetary policy tightening this year.\\n5/ BUY THE RUMOUR\\nChinese shares .SSEC are celebrating Beijing easing some of its draconian COVID rules, including shortening quarantines by two days for close contacts of infected people and for inbound travellers. This comes despite cases on the mainland at 6-month highs and some big cities under fresh lockdowns.\\nUpcoming data will be a rude reminder of the toll the strict COVID policy has been taking: retail sales are falling, industrial production has been hurt by strict lockdowns during last month\\'s 20th Party Congress, and property sales are in an extended decline.\\nThe glass-half full view sees green shoots in promises the authorities have made on growth and hopes for more policy support.

Incidentally, May was when Luna Classic effectively crashed to zero in a matter of days, erasing a market capitalization that had once exceeded $40 billion.\\nBad actors and crashes are why the cryptocurrency sector is often ridiculed by investors. It\\'s viewed as a place for get-rich-quick speculators, not serious capital allocators.\\nMuch of the criticism is fair. However, in some select cases, I believe cryptocurrency can really be a viable long-term investment. But first you\\'ll want to understand the difference between cryptocurrencies and tokens. Here\\'s why.\\nInvesting in digital currencies\\nIn my opinion, cryptocurrencies can be thrown into two buckets. One bucket is digital currency. The other is the token bucket.\\nThe distinguishing factor between these two buckets is purpose. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is meant to be used as a method of payment. The same is true for alternatives to Bitcoin like Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE). Their purpose is to facilitate financial transactions, even though people more frequently \"hodl\" these coins instead of use them as money.\\nThe investment thesis for a digital currency is conceptually no different from the one behind foreign exchange (forex) trading. If you believe the Japanese yen is going to outperform the U.S. dollar, for example, you can exchange dollars for yen and wait for it to happen.\\nThe same is true with Bitcoin. You can use it to buy something -- in those limited places where it\\'s accepted -- just as you can buy things with yen. But if you\\'re investing in Bitcoin, then you\\'re expecting it to outperform the dollar.\\nAt the most basic level, the value of any cryptocurrency is derived the same way. If demand is greater than supply, then the price goes up. And this is why Bitcoin is my digital currency investment of choice. There can only ever be 21 million Bitcoins -- the supply is a well-known factor here. And if any digital currency is going to have broad demand, I believe Bitcoin has the greatest chance.\\nThis is partly due to the strength of the Bitcoin network. Miners have computers for processing transactions. This computing power is measured with something called the hash rate. As of this writing, the total hash rate of the Bitcoin network is about 213 million tera-hashes per second (TH/s) -- the most computing power of any cryptocurrency and up more than double from this time last year. In short, Bitcoin has the most computers backing it, making it the most stable and secure (in theory).\\nWith these strengths, I could see Bitcoin continuing to receive a lot of demand.\\nInvesting in tokens\\nBy contrast, tokens have use cases other than as a medium of exchange. Take Theta Network as an example here. Theta aims to use blockchain technologies to provide a decentralized content delivery network like Fastly or Cloudflare, decentralized web hosting like Amazon and Alphabet, and more. Theta (CRYPTO: THETA) is the governance token, whereas Theta Fuel (CRYPTO: TFUEL) is the utility or gas token.\\nI think Theta Network is a really great idea. However, I\\'m not convinced Theta Fuel would be a good long-term investment. Theta Fuel has 7% to 9% annual inflation. This new Theta Fuel is created to pay nodes for keeping the network running. Users buy Theta Fuel and then spend it to use Theta\\'s services -- if you\\'re going to upload a video, for example, you\\'d spend Theta Fuel to get nodes to host it.\\nIt\\'s hard enough to create demand for Theta in the first place. Getting enough demand to offset the impact of token inflation is even harder. But then again, Theta Fuel isn\\'t designed to go up in value necessarily. It\\'s designed to buy use of the network. Imagine if the token\\'s value soared to the stratosphere. It might become cost prohibitive to actually use it. That would be counterproductive and hurt long-term adoption.\\nEvery cryptocurrency has different elements controlling supply and incentivizing demand -- tokenomics. Understanding how the tokenomics work is a completely different exercise from simply understanding what the crypto project does.\\nWhy it matters\\nDistinguishing between digital currencies and tokens is important because investors will want to look at different factors in each case. With something like Theta, you\\'ll want to see more nodes joining the network so it can deliver the faster internet speeds it promises. By contrast, with Bitcoin, you\\'ll probably want to see growth in wallets rather than miners. Bitcoin\\'s miner network is already quite large and secure. But more people need to join the Bitcoin economy and hold it and use it if the price is going to keep going up.\\nCryptocurrency really can be an investment for the long term in certain cases.

After peaking at nearly $3 trillion last November, the entire industry has shed roughly 50% of its value as of May 10, scaring investors away and keeping them on the sidelines.\\nHowever, for those with a long-term mindset, now might be a fantastic opportunity to buy digital assets. When everyone around you is pessimistic and in a state of panic, you can purchase crypto at a meaningful discount to recent highs.\\nIt's a good time to play offense. Here's why Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is the one cryptocurrency you should buy and hold forever.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nBitcoin has the first-mover advantage\\nAccording to CoinMarketCap.com, there are more than 19,000 different cryptocurrencies. And Bitcoin's advantage over all of them is that it has been around for the longest amount of time. Having been founded in 2009 on the heels of the Great Recession, Bitcoin is just two years younger than the first iPhone.\\nI believe that this longevity matters, particularly with a quickly evolving and nascent asset class like cryptocurrency. In my opinion, the longer that Bitcoin remains relevant with each passing year, the lower the chances are that it ever goes away.\\nDemonstrating its resiliency, Bitcoin has had multiple drawdowns of 50% or more in its past, only to bounce back stronger than before each time. And even with it currently being down 46% from its all-time high, it still doesn't look like it's going away.\\nFurthermore, Bitcoin's broad recognition has made it a household name -- 86% of Americans have heard about cryptocurrencies. For people new to crypto, Bitcoin is most likely their first exposure to the asset class.\\nIt's hard for me to envision a future where cryptocurrencies become mainstream, but Bitcoin isn't a part of that. While a popular blockchain like Ethereum, with its smart-contract functionality and budding ecosystem of decentralized applications, might be more exciting because of potential use cases, I think Bitcoin's ability to fundamentally change how people interact with money is a profound development.\\nAs a result, I think it is probably the safest and least-speculative crypto for investors. Remember: This is a long-term game.\\nBitcoin is becoming a legitimate financial asset\\nBesides its age, Bitcoin is also a top crypto to buy and hold forever because of its growing legitimacy as a true financial asset. There is an expanding infrastructure of products and services that support Bitcoin. Goldman Sachs has a dedicated Bitcoin trading desk, and there is a growing list of Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds. Businesses like Coinbase Global and PayPal Holdings make it easy not only to buy and hold Bitcoin, but also to spend it.\\nInvestors are increasingly beginning to view Bitcoin as a store of value. Despite its gut-wrenching volatility, Bitcoin's 1,670% return over the past five years far outpaces the 18% rise in the Consumer Price Index during the same time. On a short-term basis, Bitcoin might not be a useful inflation hedge. But over an extended period of time, it has proved it can significantly boost purchasing power, which is essentially the objective of all investing.\\nCountries like El Salvador and the Central African Republic have made Bitcoin legal tender within their borders, a step I think that more lower-income, developing nations will pursue. Whether citizens actually transact with Bitcoin in their daily lives is overshadowed by the fact that these countries are attempting to get ahead of the innovation curve.\\nBitcoin belongs in your portfolio\\nWith the government's unprecedented monetary stimulus efforts over the past couple of years, in addition to burgeoning public debt levels, owning Bitcoin looks like an escape from the traditional financial system. This is my perspective. The fact that it can't be controlled by any single entity, unlike the U.S. dollar, makes it appealing. With a cap of 21 million coins, demand for Bitcoin will likely rise in the future -- and so will its price.\\nRegardless of what so-called experts say, it's impossible to put a price target on Bitcoin. There are just too many unknowns, like the regulatory environment and mainstream adoption trends. But I think it's prudent to allocate 1% to 2% of your portfolio to Bitcoin. The downside is limited with that small amount, but the upside is massive. That's an attractive asymmetric bet worth taking.\\n10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin\\nWhen our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
